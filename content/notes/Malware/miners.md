title: Miners ⚒️
---
- Sometimes you can find that a process is consuming to much or maybe analyzing the processes running you see something anomaly
	- For the command of displaying linux services and running processes visit [Some Linux cheatsheet commands 👾](cheatsheet_commands_linux.md)

- Once you find the suspicious process or service, you can download the files associated to it and analyze them on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/)

- If you discover a miner, try to search the file where the malware is being executed and then you could find out the wallet address and more.
	- You might find the wallet addres encoded like:

- So you must decode it on [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/) for example
	- Otherwise, checkout [Translation and Shifting (Format encoding) 🥭](translation_and_shifting.md)

- Rember that it can be obfuscated, so you might separate the base64 decoded identifier like:
- `bc1qyk79fcp9hd5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qabc1qyk79fcp9had5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa` -> 
	- `bc1qyk79fcp9hd5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa`
	- `bc1qyk79fcp9had5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa`

- Then you can search it in [Blockchain Explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/search?search=bc1qyk79fcp9hd5kreprce89tkh4wrtl8avt4l67qa)
