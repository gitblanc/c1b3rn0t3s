# Enumeration Principles

Enumeration is a widely used term in cyber security. It stands for information gathering using active (scans) and passive (use of third-party providers) methods. It is important to note that OSINT is an independent procedure and should be performed separately from enumeration becauseÂ `OSINT is based exclusively on passive information gathering`Â and does not involve active enumeration of the given target. Enumeration is a loop in which we repeatedly gather information based on what data we have or have already discovered.

Information can be gathered from domains, IP addresses, accessible services, and many other sources.

Once we have identified targets in our client's infrastructure, we need to examine the individual services and protocols. In most cases, these are services that enable communication between customers, the infrastructure, the administration, and the employees.

If we imagine that we have been hired to investigate the IT security of a company, we will start to develop a general understanding of the company's functionality. For example, we need to understand how the company is structured, what services and third-party vendors it uses, what security measures may be in place, and more. This is where this stage can be a bit misunderstood because most people focus on the obvious and try to force their way into the company's systems instead of understanding how the infrastructure is set up and what technical aspects and services are necessary to be able to offer a specific service.

An example of such a wrong approach could be that after finding authentication services like SSH, RDP, WinRM, and the like, we try to brute-force with common/weak passwords and usernames. Unfortunately, brute-forcing is a noisy method and can easily lead to blacklisting, making further testing impossible. Primarily, this can happen if we do not know about the company's defensive security measures and its infrastructure. Some may smile at this approach, but experience has shown that far too many testers take this type of approach.

`Our goal is not to get at the systems but to find all the ways to get there.`

We can think of this as an analogy of a treasure hunter preparing for his expedition. He would not just grab a shovel and start digging in some random spot, but he would plan and gather his gear and study maps and learn about the terrain he has to cover and where the treasure may be so he can bring the proper tools. If he goes around digging holes everywhere, he will cause damage, waste time and energy, and likely never achieve his goal. The same can be said for understanding a company's internal and external infrastructure, mapping it out, and carefully formulating our plan of attack.

The enumeration principles are based on some questions that will facilitate all our investigations in any conceivable situation. In most cases, the main focus of many penetration testers is on what they can see and not on what they cannot see. However, even what we cannot see is relevant to us and may well be of great importance. The difference here is that we start to see the components and aspects that are not visible at first glance with our experience.

- What can we see?
- What reasons can we have for seeing it?
- What image does what we see create for us?
- What do we gain from it?
- How can we use it?
- What can we not see?
- What reasons can there be that we do not see?
- What image results for us from what we do not see?

An important aspect that must not be confused here is that there are always exceptions to the rules. The principles, however, do not change. Another advantage of these principles is that we can see from the practical tasks that we do not lack penetration testing abilities but technical understanding when we suddenly do not know how to proceed because our core task is not to exploit the machines but to find how they can be exploited.

|**`No.`**|**`Principle`**|
|---|---|
|1.|There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view.|
|2.|Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.|
|3.|There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target.|

To familiarize ourselves with these principles, we should write down these questions and principles where we can always see them and refer back to them with ease.

# Enumeration Methodology

Complex processes must have a standardized methodology that helps us keep our bearings and avoid omitting any aspects by mistake. Especially with the variety of cases that the target systems can offer us, it is almost unpredictable how our approach should be designed. Therefore, most penetration testers follow their habits and the steps they feel most comfortable and familiar with. However, this is not a standardized methodology but rather an experience-based approach.

We know that penetration testing, and therefore enumeration, is a dynamic process. Consequently, we have developed a static enumeration methodology for external and internal penetration tests that includes free dynamics and allows for a wide range of changes and adaptations to the given environment. This methodology is nested in 6 layers and represents, metaphorically speaking, boundaries that we try to pass with the enumeration process. The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:

| `Infrastructure-based enumeration` | `Host-based enumeration` | `OS-based enumeration` |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523153320.png)

>[!Note]
>The components of each layer shown represent the main categories and not a full list of all the components to search for. Additionally, it must be mentioned here that the first and second layer (Internet Presence, Gateway) does not quite apply to the intranet, such as an Active Directory infrastructure. The layers for internal infrastructure will be covered in other modules.

Consider these lines as some kind of obstacle, like a wall, for example. What we do here is look around to find out where the entrance is, or the gap we can fit through, or climb over to get closer to our goal. Theoretically, it is also possible to go through the wall headfirst, but very often, it happens that the spot we have smashed the gap with a lot of effort and time with force does not bring us much because there is no entry at this point of the wall to pass on to the next wall.

These layers are designed as follows:

|**Layer**|**Description**|**Information Categories**|
|---|---|---|
|`1. Internet Presence`|Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.|Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures|
|`2. Gateway`|Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.|Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare|
|`3. Accessible Services`|Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.|Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface|
|`4. Processes`|Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.|PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination|
|`5. Privileges`|Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.|Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment|
|`6. OS Setup`|Identification of the internal components and systems setup.|OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files|

>[!Important]
>The human aspect and the information that can be obtained by employees using OSINT have been removed from the "Internet Presence" layer for simplicity.

We can finally imagine the entire penetration test in the form of a labyrinth where we have to identify the gaps and find the way to get us inside as quickly and effectively as possible. This type of labyrinth may look something like this:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523153407.png)

>[!Note]
>The squares represent the gaps/vulnerabilities.

As we have probably already noticed, we can see that we will encounter one gap and very likely several. The interesting and very common fact is that not all the gaps we find can lead us inside. All penetration tests are limited in time, but we should always keep in mind that one belief that there is nearly always a way in. Even after a four-week penetration test, we cannot say 100% that there are no more vulnerabilities. Someone who has been studying the company for months and analyzing them will most likely have a much greater understanding of the applications and structure than we were able to gain within the few weeks we spent on the assessment. An excellent and recent example of this is theÂ [cyber attack on SolarWinds](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/the-solarwinds-cyberattack), which happened not too long ago. This is another excellent reason for a methodology that must exclude such cases.

Let us assume that we have been asked to perform an external "black box" penetration test. Once all the necessary contract items have been completely fulfilled, our penetration test will begin at the specified time.

## Layer No.1: Internet Presence

The first layer we have to pass is the "Internet Presence" layer, where we focus on finding the targets we can investigate. If the scope in the contract allows us to look for additional hosts, this layer is even more critical than for fixed targets only. In this layer, we use different techniques to find domains, subdomains, netblocks, and many other components and information that present the presence of the company and its infrastructure on the Internet.

`The goal of this layer is to identify all possible target systems and interfaces that can be tested.`

## Layer No.2: Gateway

Here we try to understand the interface of the reachable target, how it is protected, and where it is located in the network. Due to the diversity, different functionalities, and some particular procedures, we will go into more detail about this layer in other modules.

`The goal is to understand what we are dealing with and what we have to watch out for.`

## Layer No.3: Accessible Services

In the case of accessible services, we examine each destination for all the services it offers. Each of these services has a specific purpose that has been installed for a particular reason by the administrator. Each service has certain functions, which therefore also lead to specific results. To work effectively with them, we need to know how they work. Otherwise, we need to learn to understand them.

`This layer aims to understand the reason and functionality of the target system and gain the necessary knowledge to communicate with it and exploit it for our purposes effectively.`

This is the part of enumeration we will mainly deal with in this module.

## Layer No.4: Processes

Every time a command or function is executed, data is processed, whether entered by the user or generated by the system. This starts a process that has to perform specific tasks, and such tasks have at least one source and one target.

`The goal here is to understand these factors and identify the dependencies between them.`

## Layer No.5: Privileges

Each service runs through a specific user in a particular group with permissions and privileges defined by the administrator or the system. These privileges often provide us with functions that administrators overlook. This often happens in Active Directory infrastructures and many other case-specific administration environments and servers where users are responsible for multiple administration areas.

`It is crucial to identify these and understand what is and is not possible with these privileges.`

## Layer No.6: OS Setup

Here we collect information about the actual operating system and its setup using internal access. This gives us a good overview of the internal security of the systems and reflects the skills and capabilities of the company's administrative teams.

`The goal here is to see how the administrators manage the systems and what sensitive internal information we can glean from them.`

## Enumeration Methodology in Practice

A methodology summarizes all systematic procedures in obtaining knowledge within the bounds of a given objective. It is important to note that a methodology is not a step-by-step guide but, as the definition implies, a summary of systematic procedures. In our case, the enumeration methodology is the systematic approach to explore a given target.

How the individual components are identified and information obtained in this methodology is a dynamic and growing aspect that is constantly changing and can therefore differ. An excellent example of this is using information-gathering tools from web servers. There are countless different tools for this, and each of them has a specific focus and therefore delivers individual results that differ from other applications. The goal, however, is the same. Thus, the collection of tools and commands is not part of the actual methodology but rather a cheat sheet that we can refer to using the commands and tools listed in given cases.

# Domain Information

Domain information is a core component of any penetration test, and it is not just about the subdomains but about the entire presence on the Internet. Therefore, we gather information and try to understand the company's functionality and which technologies and structures are necessary for services to be offered successfully and efficiently.

This type of information is gathered passively without direct and active scans. In other words, we remain hidden and navigate as "customers" or "visitors" to avoid direct connections to the company that could expose us. The OSINT relevant sections are only a tiny part of how in-depth OSINT goes and describe only a few of the many ways to obtain information in this way. More approaches and strategies for this can be found in the moduleÂ [OSINT: Corporate Recon](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/osint-corporate-recon).

However, whenÂ `passively`Â gathering information, we can use third-party services to understand the company better. However, the first thing we should do is scrutinize the company'sÂ `main website`. Then, we should read through the texts, keeping in mind what technologies and structures are needed for these services.

For example, many IT companies offer app development, IoT, hosting, data science, and IT security services, depending on their industry. If we encounter a service that we have had little to do with before, it makes sense and is necessary to get to grips with it and find out what activities it consists of and what opportunities are available. Those services also give us a good overview of how the company can be structured.

For example, this part is the combination between theÂ `first principle`Â and theÂ `second principle`Â of enumeration. We pay attention to whatÂ `we see`Â andÂ `we do not see`. We see the services but not their functionality. However, services are bound to certain technical aspects necessary to provide a service. Therefore, we take the developer's view and look at the whole thing from their point of view. This point of view allows us to gain many technical insights into the functionality.

## Online Presence

Once we have a basic understanding of the company and its services, we can get a first impression of its presence on the Internet. Let us assume that a medium-sized company has hired us to test their entire infrastructure from a black-box perspective. This means we have only received a scope of targets and must obtain all further information ourselves.

>[!Note]
>Please remember that the examples below will differ from the practical exercises and will not give the same results. However, the examples are based on real penetration tests and illustrate how and what information can be obtained.

The first point of presence on the Internet may be theÂ `SSL certificate`Â from the company's main website that we can examine. Often, such a certificate includes more than just a subdomain, and this means that the certificate is used for several domains, and these are most likely still active.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523154951.png)

Another source to find more subdomains isÂ [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/). This source isÂ [Certificate Transparency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency)Â logs. Certificate Transparency is a process that is intended to enable the verification of issued digital certificates for encrypted Internet connections. The standard ([RFC 6962](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962)) provides for the logging of all digital certificates issued by a certificate authority in audit-proof logs. This is intended to enable the detection of false or maliciously issued certificates for a domain. SSL certificate providers likeÂ [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)Â share this with the web interfaceÂ [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/), which stores the new entries in the database to be accessed later.

`https://www.crt.sh/?q=inlanefreight.com`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523155014.png)

We can also output the results in JSON format.

If needed, we can also have them filtered by the unique subdomains.

```shell

```

Next, we can identify the hosts directly accessible from the Internet and not hosted by third-party providers. This is because we are not allowed to test the hosts without the permission of third-party providers.

#### Company Hosted Servers

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done

blog.inlanefreight.com 10.129.24.93
inlanefreight.com 10.129.27.33
matomo.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.22
www.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.33
s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com 10.129.95.250
```

Once we see which hosts can be investigated further, we can generate a list of IP addresses with a minor adjustment to theÂ `cut`Â command and run them throughÂ `Shodan`.

[Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/)Â can be used to find devices and systems permanently connected to the Internet likeÂ `Internet of Things`Â (`IoT`). It searches the Internet for open TCP/IP ports and filters the systems according to specific terms and criteria. For example, open HTTP or HTTPS ports and other server ports forÂ `FTP`,Â `SSH`,Â `SNMP`,Â `Telnet`,Â `RTSP`, orÂ `SIP`Â are searched. As a result, we can find devices and systems, such asÂ `surveillance cameras`,Â `servers`,Â `smart home systems`,Â `industrial controllers`,Â `traffic lights`Â andÂ `traffic controllers`, and various network components.

#### Shodan - IP List

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f4 >> ip-addresses.txt;done
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat ip-addresses.txt);do shodan host $i;done

Let us look at what we have learned here and come back to our principles. We see an IP record, some mail servers, some DNS servers, TXT records, and an SOA record.

- `A`Â records: We recognize the IP addresses that point to a specific (sub)domain through the A record. Here we only see one that we already know.
- `MX`Â records: The mail server records show us which mail server is responsible for managing the emails for the company. Since this is handled by google in our case, we should note this and skip it for now.
- `NS`Â records: These kinds of records show which name servers are used to resolve the FQDN to IP addresses. Most hosting providers use their own name servers, making it easier to identify the hosting provider.
- `TXT`Â records: this type of record often contains verification keys for different third-party providers and other security aspects of DNS, such asÂ [SPF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7208),Â [DMARC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7489), andÂ [DKIM](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6376), which are responsible for verifying and confirming the origin of the emails sent. Here we can already see some valuable information if we look closer at the results.

```shell
...SNIP... TXT     "MS=ms92346782372"
...SNIP... TXT     "atlassian-domain-verification=IJdXMt1rKCy68JFszSdCKVpwPN"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=O7zV5-xFh_jn7JQ31"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=bow47-er9LdgoUeah"
...SNIP... TXT     "google-site-verification=gZsCG-BINLopf4hr2"
...SNIP... TXT     "logmein-verification-code=87123gff5a479e-61d4325gddkbvc1-b2bnfghfsed1-3c789427sdjirew63fc"
...SNIP... TXT     "v=spf1 include:mailgun.org include:_spf.google.com include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:_spf.atlassian.net ip4:10.129.24.8 ip4:10.129.27.2 ip4:10.72.82.106 ~all"
```

What we could see so far were entries on the DNS server, which at first glance did not look very interesting (except for the additional IP addresses). However, we could not see the third-party providers behind the entries shown at first glance. The core information we can see now is:

| [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) | [Google Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/) | [LogMeIn](https://www.logmein.com/)         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)     | [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/)      | [INWX](https://www.inwx.com/en)Â ID/Username |
| 10.129.24.8                             | 10.129.27.2                                   | 10.72.82.106                                |

- For example,Â [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/)Â states that the company uses this solution for software development and collaboration. If we are not familiar with this platform, we can try it for free to get acquainted with it.
- [Google Gmail](https://www.google.com/gmail/)Â indicates that Google is used for email management. Therefore, it can also suggest that we could access open GDrive folders or files with a link.
- [LogMeIn](https://www.logmein.com/)Â is a central place that regulates and manages remote access on many different levels. However, the centralization of such operations is a double-edged sword. If access as an administrator to this platform is obtained (e.g., through password reuse), one also has complete access to all systems and information.
- [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/)Â offers several email APIs, SMTP relays, and webhooks with which emails can be managed. This tells us to keep our eyes open for API interfaces that we can then test for various vulnerabilities such as IDOR, SSRF, POST, PUT requests, and many other attacks.
- [Outlook](https://outlook.live.com/owa/)Â is another indicator for document management. Companies often use Office 365 with OneDrive and cloud resources such as Azure blob and file storage. Azure file storage can be very interesting because it works with the SMB protocol.
- The last thing we see isÂ [INWX](https://www.inwx.com/en). This company seems to be a hosting provider where domains can be purchased and registered. The TXT record with the "MS" value is often used to confirm the domain. In most cases, it is similar to the username or ID used to log in to the management platform.

# Cloud Resources

he use of cloud, such asÂ [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/),Â [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/),Â [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), and others, is now one of the essential components for many companies nowadays. After all, all companies want to be able to do their work from anywhere, so they need a central point for all management. This is why services fromÂ `Amazon`Â (`AWS`),Â `Google`Â (`GCP`), andÂ `Microsoft`Â (`Azure`) are ideal for this purpose.

Even though cloud providers secure their infrastructure centrally, this does not mean that companies are free from vulnerabilities. The configurations made by the administrators may nevertheless make the company's cloud resources vulnerable. This often starts with theÂ `S3 buckets`Â (AWS),Â `blobs`Â (Azure),Â `cloud storage`Â (GCP), which can be accessed without authentication if configured incorrectly.

#### Company Hosted Servers

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(cat subdomainlist);do host $i | grep "has address" | grep inlanefreight.com | cut -d" " -f1,4;done

blog.inlanefreight.com 10.129.24.93
inlanefreight.com 10.129.27.33
matomo.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.22
www.inlanefreight.com 10.129.127.33
s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com 10.129.95.250
```

Often cloud storage is added to the DNS list when used for administrative purposes by other employees. This step makes it much easier for the employees to reach and manage them. Let us stay with the case that a company has contracted us, and during the IP lookup, we have already seen that one IP address belongs to theÂ `s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`Â server.

However, there are many different ways to find such cloud storage. One of the easiest and most used is Google search combined with Google Dorks. For example, we can use the Google DorksÂ `inurl:`Â andÂ `intext:`Â to narrow our search to specific terms. In the following example, we see red censored areas containing the company name.

#### Google Search for AWS

```http
intext:DOMAIN inurl:amazonaws.com
```

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523161036.png)

#### Google Search for Azure

```http
intext:DOMAIN inurl:blob.core.windows.net
```

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523161049.png)

Here we can already see that the links presented by Google contain PDFs. When we search for a company that we may already know or want to know, we will also come across other files such as text documents, presentations, codes, and many others.

Such content is also often included in the source code of the web pages, from where the images, JavaScript codes, or CSS are loaded. This procedure often relieves the web server and does not store unnecessary content.

#### Target Website - Source Code

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523161058.png)

Third-party providers such asÂ [domain.glass](https://domain.glass/)Â can also tell us a lot about the company's infrastructure. As a positive side effect, we can also see that Cloudflare's security assessment status has been classified as "Safe". This means we have already found a security measure that can be noted for the second layer (gateway).

#### Domain.Glass Results

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523161106.png)

Another very useful provider isÂ [GrayHatWarfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/). We can do many different searches, discover AWS, Azure, and GCP cloud storage, and even sort and filter by file format. Therefore, once we have found them through Google, we can also search for them on GrayHatWarefare and passively discover what files are stored on the given cloud storage.

#### GrayHatWarfare Results

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523161113.png)

Many companies also use abbreviations of the company name, which are then used accordingly within the IT infrastructure. Such terms are also part of an excellent approach to discovering new cloud storage from the company. We can also search for files simultaneously to see the files that can be accessed at the same time.

#### Private and Public SSH Keys Leaked

Sometimes when employees are overworked or under high pressure, mistakes can be fatal for the entire company. These errors can even lead to SSH private keys being leaked, which anyone can download and log onto one or even more machines in the company without using a password.

#### SSH Private Key

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523161126.png)

# Staff

Searching for and identifying employees on social media platforms can also reveal a lot about the teams' infrastructure and makeup. This, in turn, can lead to us identifying which technologies, programming languages, and even software applications are being used. To a large extent, we will also be able to assess each person's focus based on their skills. The posts and material shared with others are also a great indicator of what the person is currently engaged in and what that person currently feels is important to share with others.

Employees can be identified on various business networks such asÂ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)Â orÂ [Xing](https://www.xing.de/). Job postings from companies can also tell us a lot about their infrastructure and give us clues about what we should be looking for.

From a job post like this, we can see, for example, which programming languages are preferred:Â `Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl`. It also required that the applicant be familiar with different databases, such as:Â `PostgreSQL, Mysql, and Oracle`. In addition, we know that different frameworks are used for web application development, such as:Â `Flask, Django, ASP.NET, Spring`.

Furthermore, we useÂ `REST APIs, Github, SVN, and Perforce`. The job offer also results that the company works with Atlassian Suite, and therefore there may be resources that we could potentially access. We can see some skills and projects from the career history that give us a reasonable estimate of the employee's knowledge.

#### LinkedIn - Employee #1 About

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523162109.png)

We try to make business contacts on social media sites and prove to visitors what skills we bring to the table, which inevitably leads to us sharing with the public what we know and what we have learned so far. Companies always hire employees whose skills they can use and apply to the business. For example, we know that Flask and Django are web frameworks for the Python programming language.

If we do a little search for Django security misconfigurations, we will eventually come across the followingÂ [Github repository](https://github.com/boomcamp/django-security)Â that describes OWASP Top10 for Django. We can use this to understand the inner structure of Django and how it works. The best practices also often tell us what to look for. Because many blindly trust them and even name many of the files as shown in the instructions.

#### Github

Showing our projects can, of course, be of great advantage to make new business contacts and possibly even get a new job, but on the other hand, it can lead to mistakes that will be very difficult to fix. For example, in one of the files, we can discover the employee's personal email address, and upon deeper investigation, the web application has a hardcodedÂ [JWT token](https://jwt.io/).

#### LinkedIn - Employee #2 Career

![](Pasted%20image%2020250523162152.png)

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)Â offers a comprehensive search for employed, sorted by connections, locations, companies, school, industry, profile language, services, names, titles, and more. Understandably, the more detailed information we provide there, the fewer results we get. Therefore, we should think carefully about the purpose of performing the search.

Suppose we are trying to find the infrastructure and technology the company is most likely to use. We should look for technical employees who work both in development and security. Because based on the security area and the employees who work in that area, we will also be able to determine what security measures the company has put in place to secure itself.

# FTP

TheÂ `File Transfer Protocol`Â (`FTP`) is one of the oldest protocols on the Internet. The FTP runs within the application layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Thus, it is on the same layer asÂ `HTTP`Â orÂ `POP`. These protocols also work with the support of browsers or email clients to perform their services. There are also special FTP programs for the File Transfer Protocol.

Let us imagine that we want to upload local files to a server and download other files using theÂ [FTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc959)Â protocol. In an FTP connection, two channels are opened. First, the client and server establish a control channel throughÂ `TCP port 21`. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication participants can establish the data channel viaÂ `TCP port 20`. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors during this process. If a connection is broken off during transmission, the transport can be resumed after re-established contact.

A distinction is made betweenÂ `active`Â andÂ `passive`Â FTP. In the active variant, the client establishes the connection as described via TCP port 21 and thus informs the server via which client-side port the server can transmit its responses. However, if a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked. For this purpose, theÂ `passive mode`Â has been developed. Here, the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel. Since the client initiates the connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer.

The FTP knows differentÂ [commands](https://web.archive.org/web/20230326204635/https://www.smartfile.com/blog/the-ultimate-ftp-commands-list/)Â and status codes. Not all of these commands are consistently implemented on the server. For example, the client-side instructs the server-side to upload or download files, organize directories or delete files. The server responds in each case with a status code that indicates whether the command was successfully implemented. A list of possible status codes can be foundÂ [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FTP_server_return_codes).

Usually, we need credentials to use FTP on a server. We also need to know that FTP is aÂ `clear-text`Â protocol that can sometimes be sniffed if conditions on the network are right. However, there is also the possibility that a server offersÂ `anonymous FTP`. The server operator then allows any user to upload or download files via FTP without using a password. Since there are security risks associated with such a public FTP server, the options for users are usually limited.

## TFTP

`Trivial File Transfer Protocol`Â (`TFTP`) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, itÂ `does not`Â provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP. In addition, while FTP uses TCP, TFTP usesÂ `UDP`, making it an unreliable protocol and causing it to use UDP-assisted application layer recovery.

This is reflected, for example, in the fact that TFTP, unlike FTP, does not require the user's authentication. It does not support protected login via passwords and sets limits on access based solely on the read and write permissions of a file in the operating system. Practically, this leads to TFTP operating exclusively in directories and with files that have been shared with all users and can be read and written globally. Because of the lack of security, TFTP, unlike FTP, may only be used in local and protected networks.

Let us take a look at a few commands ofÂ `TFTP`:

|**Commands**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`connect`|Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.|
|`get`|Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.|
|`put`|Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.|
|`quit`|Exits tftp.|
|`status`|Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on.|
|`verbose`|Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.|

Unlike the FTP client,Â `TFTP`Â does not have directory listing functionality.

## Default Configuration

One of the most used FTP servers on Linux-based distributions isÂ [vsFTPd](https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd.html). The default configuration of vsFTPd can be found inÂ `/etc/vsftpd.conf`, and some settings are already predefined by default. It is highly recommended to install the vsFTPd server on a VM and have a closer look at this configuration.

#### Install vsFTPd

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt install vsftpd 
```

The vsFTPd server is only one of a few FTP servers available to us. There are many different alternatives to it, which also bring, among other things, many more functions and configuration options with them. We will use the vsFTPd server because it is an excellent way to show the configuration possibilities of an FTP server in a simple and easy-to-understand way without going into the details of the man pages. If we look at the configuration file of vsFTPd, we will see many options and settings that are either commented or commented out. However, the configuration file does not contain all possible settings that can be made. The existing and missing ones can be found on theÂ [man page](http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html).

#### vsFTPd Config File

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/vsftpd.conf | grep -v "#"
```

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`listen=NO`|Run from inetd or as a standalone daemon?|
|`listen_ipv6=YES`|Listen on IPv6 ?|
|`anonymous_enable=NO`|Enable Anonymous access?|
|`local_enable=YES`|Allow local users to login?|
|`dirmessage_enable=YES`|Display active directory messages when users go into certain directories?|
|`use_localtime=YES`|Use local time?|
|`xferlog_enable=YES`|Activate logging of uploads/downloads?|
|`connect_from_port_20=YES`|Connect from port 20?|
|`secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty`|Name of an empty directory|
|`pam_service_name=vsftpd`|This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.|
|`rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem`|The last three options specify the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL encrypted connections.|
|`rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key`||
|`ssl_enable=NO`||

In addition, there is a file calledÂ `/etc/ftpusers`Â that we also need to pay attention to, as this file is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service. In the following example, the usersÂ `guest`,Â `john`, andÂ `kevin`Â are not permitted to log in to the FTP service, even if they exist on the Linux system.

#### FTPUSERS

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/ftpusers

guest
john
kevin
```

## Dangerous Settings

There are many different security-related settings we can make on each FTP server. These can have various purposes, such as testing connections through the firewalls, testing routes, and authentication mechanisms. One of these authentication mechanisms is theÂ `anonymous`Â user. This is often used to allow everyone on the internal network to share files and data without accessing each other's computers. With vsFTPd, theÂ [optional settings](http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html)Â that can be added to the configuration file for the anonymous login look like this:

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`anonymous_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous login?|
|`anon_upload_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous to upload files?|
|`anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES`|Allowing anonymous to create new directories?|
|`no_anon_password=YES`|Do not ask anonymous for password?|
|`anon_root=/home/username/ftp`|Directory for anonymous.|
|`write_enable=YES`|Allow the usage of FTP commands: STOR, DELE, RNFR, RNTO, MKD, RMD, APPE, and SITE?|

With the standard FTP client (`ftp`), we can access the FTP server accordingly and log in with the anonymous user if the settings shown above have been used. The use of the anonymous account can occur in internal environments and infrastructures where the participants are all known. Access to this type of service can be set temporarily or with the setting to accelerate the exchange of files.

As soon as we connect to the vsFTPd server, theÂ `response code 220`Â is displayed with the banner of the FTP server. Often this banner contains the description of theÂ `service`Â and even theÂ `version`Â of it. It also tells us what type of system the FTP server is. One of the most common configurations of FTP servers is to allowÂ `anonymous`Â access, which does not require legitimate credentials but provides access to some files. Even if we cannot download them, sometimes just listing the contents is enough to generate further ideas and note down information that will help us in another approach.

#### Anonymous Login

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ ftp 10.129.14.136

```

However, to get the first overview of the server's settings, we can use the following command:

#### vsFTPd Status

```shell
ftp> status

Connected to 10.129.14.136.
No proxy connection.
Connecting using address family: any.
Mode: stream; Type: binary; Form: non-print; Structure: file
Verbose: on; Bell: off; Prompting: on; Globbing: on
Store unique: off; Receive unique: off
Case: off; CR stripping: on
Quote control characters: on
Ntrans: off
Nmap: off
Hash mark printing: off; Use of PORT cmds: on
Tick counter printing: off
```

Some commands should be used occasionally, as these will make the server show us more information that we can use for our purposes. These commands includeÂ `debug`Â andÂ `trace`.

#### vsFTPd Detailed Output

```shell

```

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`dirmessage_enable=YES`|Show a message when they first enter a new directory?|
|`chown_uploads=YES`|Change ownership of anonymously uploaded files?|
|`chown_username=username`|User who is given ownership of anonymously uploaded files.|
|`local_enable=YES`|Enable local users to login?|
|`chroot_local_user=YES`|Place local users into their home directory?|
|`chroot_list_enable=YES`|Use a list of local users that will be placed in their home directory?|

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`hide_ids=YES`|All user and group information in directory listings will be displayed as "ftp".|
|`ls_recurse_enable=YES`|Allows the use of recurse listings.|

In the following example, we can see that if theÂ `hide_ids=YES`Â setting is present, the UID and GUID representation of the service will be overwritten, making it more difficult for us to identify with which rights these files are written and uploaded.

#### Hiding IDs - YES

This setting is a security feature to prevent local usernames from being revealed. With the usernames, we could attack the services like FTP and SSH and many others with a brute-force attack in theory. However, in reality,Â [fail2ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail2ban)Â solutions are now a standard implementation of any infrastructure that logs the IP address and blocks all access to the infrastructure after a certain number of failed login attempts.

Another helpful setting we can use for our purposes is theÂ `ls_recurse_enable=YES`. This is often set on the vsFTPd server to have a better overview of the FTP directory structure, as it allows us to see all the visible content at once.

`Downloading`Â files from such an FTP server is one of the main features, as well asÂ `uploading`Â files created by us. This allows us, for example, to use LFI vulnerabilities to make the host execute system commands. Apart from the files, we can view, download and inspect. Attacks are also possible with the FTP logs, leading toÂ `Remote Command Execution`Â (`RCE`). This applies to the FTP services and all those we can detect during our enumeration phase.

#### Download a File

```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ ls | grep Notes.txt

```

We also can download all the files and folders we have access to at once. This is especially useful if the FTP server has many different files in a larger folder structure. However, this can cause alarms because no one from the company usually wants to download all files and content all at once.

#### Download All Available Files

Next, we can check if we have the permissions to upload files to the FTP server. Especially with web servers, it is common that files are synchronized, and the developers have quick access to the files. FTP is often used for this purpose, and most of the time, configuration errors are found on servers that the administrators think are not discoverable. The attitude that internal network components cannot be accessed from the outside means that the hardening of internal systems is often neglected and leads to misconfigurations.

The ability to upload files to the FTP server connected to a web server increases the likelihood of gaining direct access to the webserver and even a reverse shell that allows us to execute internal system commands and perhaps even escalate our privileges.

#### Upload a File

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ touch testupload.txt
```

With theÂ `PUT`Â command, we can upload files in the current folder to the FTP server.

```shell
ftp> put testupload.txt 

local: testupload.txt remote: testupload.txt
---> PORT 10,10,14,4,184,33
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.

## Footprinting the Service

Footprinting using various network scanners is also a handy and widespread approach. These tools make it easier for us to identify different services, even if they are not accessible on standard ports. One of the most widely used tools for this purpose is Nmap. Nmap also brings theÂ [Nmap Scripting Engine](https://nmap.org/book/nse.html)Â (`NSE`), a set of many different scripts written for specific services. More information on the capabilities of Nmap and NSE can be found in theÂ [Network Enumeration with Nmap](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/network-enumeration-with-nmap)Â module. We can update this database of NSE scripts with the command shown.

#### Nmap FTP Scripts

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap --script-updatedb

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-19 13:49 CEST
NSE: Updating rule database.
NSE: Script Database updated successfully.
Nmap done: 0 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.28 seconds
```

All the NSE scripts are located on the Pwnbox inÂ `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/`, but on our systems, we can find them using a simple command on our system.

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f -name ftp* 2>/dev/null | grep scripts

/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-syst.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-vsftpd-backdoor.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-vuln-cve2010-4221.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-proftpd-backdoor.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-bounce.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-libopie.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-anon.nse
/usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp-brute.nse
```

As we already know, the FTP server usually runs on the standard TCP port 21, which we can scan using Nmap. We also use the version scan (`-sV`), aggressive scan (`-A`), and the default script scan (`-sC`) against our targetÂ `10.129.14.136`.

#### Nmap

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.14.136

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-16 18:12 CEST

```

The default script scan is based on the services' fingerprints, responses, and standard ports. Once Nmap has detected the service, it executes the marked scripts one after the other, providing different information. For example, theÂ [ftp-anon](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ftp-anon.html)Â NSE script checks whether the FTP server allows anonymous access. If so, the contents of the FTP root directory are rendered for the anonymous user.

TheÂ `ftp-syst`, for example, executes theÂ `STAT`Â command, which displays information about the FTP server status. This includes configurations as well as the version of the FTP server. Nmap also provides the ability to trace the progress of NSE scripts at the network level if we use theÂ `--script-trace`Â option in our scans. This lets us see what commands Nmap sends, what ports are used, and what responses we receive from the scanned server.

#### Nmap Script Trace

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sV -p21 -sC -A 10.129.14.136 --script-trace

```

The scan history shows that four different parallel scans are running against the service, with various timeouts. For the NSE scripts, we see that our local machine uses other output ports (`54226`,Â `54228`,Â `54230`,Â `54232`) and first initiates the connection with theÂ `CONNECT`Â command. From the first response from the server, we can see that we are receiving the banner from the server to our second NSE script (`54228`) from the target FTP server. If necessary, we can, of course, use other applications such asÂ `netcat`Â orÂ `telnet`Â to interact with the FTP server.

#### Service Interaction

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.14.136 21
```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.136 21
```

It looks slightly different if the FTP server runs with TLS/SSL encryption. Because then we need a client that can handle TLS/SSL. For this, we can use the clientÂ `openssl`Â and communicate with the FTP server. The good thing about usingÂ `openssl`Â is that we can see the SSL certificate, which can also be helpful.

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_client -connect 10.129.14.136:21 -starttls ftp

CONNECTED(00000003)

```

This is because the SSL certificate allows us to recognize theÂ `hostname`, for example, and in most cases also anÂ `email address`Â for the organization or company. In addition, if the company has several locations worldwide, certificates can also be created for specific locations, which can also be identified using the SSL certificate.

# SMB

`Server Message Block`Â (`SMB`) is a client-server protocol that regulates access to files and entire directories and other network resources such as printers, routers, or interfaces released for the network. Information exchange between different system processes can also be handled based on the SMB protocol.Â [SMB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-smb/f210069c-7086-4dc2-885e-861d837df688)Â first became available to a broader public, for example, as part of the OS/2 network operating system LAN Manager and LAN Server. Since then, the main application area of the protocol has been the Windows operating system series in particular, whose network services support SMB in a downward-compatible manner - which means that devices with newer editions can easily communicate with devices that have an older Microsoft operating system installed. With the free software project Samba, there is also a solution that enables the use of SMB in Linux and Unix distributions and thus cross-platform communication via SMB.

The SMB protocol enables the client to communicate with other participants in the same network to access files or services shared with it on the network. The other system must also have implemented the network protocol and received and processed the client request using an SMB server application. Before that, however, both parties must establish a connection, which is why they first exchange corresponding messages.

In IP networks, SMB uses TCP protocol for this purpose, which provides for a three-way handshake between client and server before a connection is finally established. The specifications of the TCP protocol also govern the subsequent transport of data. We can take a look at some examplesÂ [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240815212710/https://winprotocoldoc.blob.core.windows.net/productionwindowsarchives/MS-SMB2/%5BMS-SMB2%5D.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A920%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C69%2C738%2C0%5D).

An SMB server can provide arbitrary parts of its local file system as shares. Therefore the hierarchy visible to a client is partially independent of the structure on the server. Access rights are defined byÂ `Access Control Lists`Â (`ACL`). They can be controlled in a fine-grained manner based on attributes such asÂ `execute`,Â `read`, andÂ `full access`Â for individual users or user groups. The ACLs are defined based on the shares and therefore do not correspond to the rights assigned locally on the server.

## Samba

As mentioned earlier, there is an alternative implementation of the SMB server called Samba, which is developed for Unix-based operating systems. Samba implements the Common Internet File System (`CIFS`) network protocol.Â [CIFS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-cifs/934c2faa-54af-4526-ac74-6a24d126724e)Â is a dialect of SMB, meaning it is a specific implementation of the SMB protocol originally created by Microsoft. This allows Samba to communicate effectively with newer Windows systems. Therefore, it is often referred to as SMB/CIFS.

However,Â `CIFS`Â is considered a specific version of the SMB protocol, primarily aligning withÂ `SMB version 1`. When SMB commands are transmitted over Samba to an older NetBIOS service, connections typically occur over TCP portsÂ `137`,Â `138`, andÂ `139`. In contrast, CIFS operates over TCP portÂ `445`Â exclusively. There are several versions of SMB, including newer versions likeÂ `SMB 2`Â andÂ `SMB 3`, which offer improvements and are preferred in modern infrastructures, while older versions likeÂ `SMB 1`Â (`CIFS`) are considered outdated but may still be used in specific environments.

|**SMB Version**|**Supported**|**Features**|
|---|---|---|
|CIFS|Windows NT 4.0|Communication via NetBIOS interface|
|SMB 1.0|Windows 2000|Direct connection via TCP|
|SMB 2.0|Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008|Performance upgrades, improved message signing, caching feature|
|SMB 2.1|Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2|Locking mechanisms|
|SMB 3.0|Windows 8, Windows Server 2012|Multichannel connections, end-to-end encryption, remote storage access|
|SMB 3.0.2|Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 R2||
|SMB 3.1.1|Windows 10, Windows Server 2016|Integrity checking, AES-128 encryption|

With version 3, the Samba server gained the ability to be a full member of an Active Directory domain. With version 4, Samba even provides an Active Directory domain controller. It contains several so-called daemons for this purpose - which are Unix background programs. The SMB server daemon (`smbd`) belonging to Samba provides the first two functionalities, while the NetBIOS message block daemon (`nmbd`) implements the last two functionalities. The SMB service controls these two background programs.

We know that Samba is suitable for both Linux and Windows systems. In a network, each host participates in the sameÂ `workgroup`. A workgroup is a group name that identifies an arbitrary collection of computers and their resources on an SMB network. There can be multiple workgroups on the network at any given time. IBM developed anÂ `application programming interface`Â (`API`) for networking computers called theÂ `Network Basic Input/Output System`Â (`NetBIOS`). The NetBIOS API provided a blueprint for an application to connect and share data with other computers. In a NetBIOS environment, when a machine goes online, it needs a name, which is done through the so-calledÂ `name registration`Â procedure. Either each host reserves its hostname on the network, or theÂ [NetBIOS Name Server](https://networkencyclopedia.com/netbios-name-server-nbns/)Â (`NBNS`) is used for this purpose. It also has been enhanced toÂ [Windows Internet Name Service](https://networkencyclopedia.com/windows-internet-name-service-wins/)Â (`WINS`).

## Default Configuration

As we can imagine, Samba offers a wide range ofÂ [settings](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smb.conf.5.html)Â that we can configure. Again, we define the settings via a text file where we can get an overview of some of the settings. These settings look like the following when filtered out:

#### Default Configuration

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/samba/smb.conf | grep -v "#\|\;" 

[global]
   workgroup = DEV.INFREIGHT.HTB
   server string = DEVSMB
   log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
   max log size = 1000
   logging = file
   panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d

   server role = standalone server
   obey pam restrictions = yes
   unix password sync = yes

   passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
   passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .

   pam password change = yes
   map to guest = bad user
   usershare allow guests = yes

[printers]
   comment = All Printers
   browseable = no
   path = /var/spool/samba
   printable = yes
   guest ok = no
   read only = yes
   create mask = 0700

[print$]
   comment = Printer Drivers
   path = /var/lib/samba/printers
   browseable = yes
   read only = yes
   guest ok = no
```

We see global settings and two shares that are intended for printers. The global settings are the configuration of the available SMB server that is used for all shares. In the individual shares, however, the global settings can be overwritten, which can be configured with high probability even incorrectly. Let us look at some of the settings to understand how the shares are configured in Samba.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`[sharename]`|The name of the network share.|
|`workgroup = WORKGROUP/DOMAIN`|Workgroup that will appear when clients query.|
|`path = /path/here/`|The directory to which user is to be given access.|
|`server string = STRING`|The string that will show up when a connection is initiated.|
|`unix password sync = yes`|Synchronize the UNIX password with the SMB password?|
|`usershare allow guests = yes`|Allow non-authenticated users to access defined share?|
|`map to guest = bad user`|What to do when a user login request doesn't match a valid UNIX user?|
|`browseable = yes`|Should this share be shown in the list of available shares?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`read only = yes`|Allow users to read files only?|
|`create mask = 0700`|What permissions need to be set for newly created files?|

## Dangerous Settings

Some of the above settings already bring some sensitive options. However, suppose we question the settings listed below and ask ourselves what the employees could gain from them, as well as attackers. In that case, we will see what advantages and disadvantages the settings bring with them. Let us take the settingÂ `browseable = yes`Â as an example. If we as administrators adopt this setting, the company's employees will have the comfort of being able to look at the individual folders with the contents. Many folders are eventually used for better organization and structure. If the employee can browse through the shares, the attacker will also be able to do so after successful access.

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`browseable = yes`|Allow listing available shares in the current share?|
|`read only = no`|Forbid the creation and modification of files?|
|`writable = yes`|Allow users to create and modify files?|
|`guest ok = yes`|Allow connecting to the service without using a password?|
|`enable privileges = yes`|Honor privileges assigned to specific SID?|
|`create mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created files?|
|`directory mask = 0777`|What permissions must be assigned to the newly created directories?|
|`logon script = script.sh`|What script needs to be executed on the user's login?|
|`magic script = script.sh`|Which script should be executed when the script gets closed?|
|`magic output = script.out`|Where the output of the magic script needs to be stored?|

Let us create a share calledÂ `[notes]`Â and a few others and see how the settings affect our enumeration process. We will use all of the above settings and apply them to this share. For example, this setting is often applied, if only for testing purposes. If it is then an internal subnet of a small team in a large department, this setting is often retained or forgotten to be reset. This leads to the fact that we can browse through all the shares and, with high probability, even download and inspect them.

#### Example Share

```shell
...SNIP...

[notes]
	comment = CheckIT
	path = /mnt/notes/

	browseable = yes
	read only = no
	writable = yes
	guest ok = yes

	enable privileges = yes
	create mask = 0777
	directory mask = 0777
```

It is highly recommended to look at the man pages for Samba and configure it ourselves and experiment with the settings. We will then discover potential aspects that will be interesting for us as a penetration tester. In addition, the more familiar we become with the Samba server and SMB, the easier it will be to find our way around the environment and use it for our purposes. Once we have adjustedÂ `/etc/samba/smb.conf`Â to our needs, we have to restart the service on the server.

#### Restart Samba

```shell
root@samba:~# sudo systemctl restart smbd
```

Now we can display a list (`-L`) of the server's shares with theÂ `smbclient`Â command from our host. We use the so-calledÂ `null session`Â (`-N`), which isÂ `anonymous`Â access without the input of existing users or valid passwords.

#### SMBclient - Connecting to the Share

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ smbclient -N -L //10.129.14.128

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        home            Disk      INFREIGHT Samba
        dev             Disk      DEVenv
        notes           Disk      CheckIT
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (DEVSM)
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

We can see that we now have five different shares on the Samba server from the result. TherebyÂ `print$`Â and anÂ `IPC$`Â are already included by default in the basic setting, as we have already seen. Since we deal with theÂ `[notes]`Â share, let us log in and inspect it using the same client program. If we are not familiar with the client program, we can use theÂ `help`Â command on successful login, listing all the possible commands we can execute.

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ smbclient //10.129.14.128/notes

Enter WORKGROUP\<username>'s password: 
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

```

Once we have discovered interesting files or folders, we can download them using theÂ `get`Â command. Smbclient also allows us to execute local system commands using an exclamation mark at the beginning (`!<cmd>`) without interrupting the connection.

#### Download Files from SMB

```shell
smb: \> get prep-prod.txt 

getting file \prep-prod.txt of size 71 as prep-prod.txt (8,7 KiloBytes/sec) 
(average 8,7 KiloBytes/sec)


smb: \> !ls

prep-prod.txt


smb: \> !cat prep-prod.txt

[] check your code with the templates
[] run code-assessment.py
[] â€¦	
```

From the administrative point of view, we can check these connections usingÂ `smbstatus`. Apart from the Samba version, we can also see who, from which host, and which share the client is connected. This is especially important once we have entered a subnet (perhaps even an isolated one) that the others can still access.

For example, with domain-level security, the samba server acts as a member of a Windows domain. Each domain has at least one domain controller, usually a Windows NT server providing password authentication. This domain controller provides the workgroup with a definitive password server. The domain controllers keep track of users and passwords in their ownÂ `NTDS.dit`Â andÂ `Security Authentication Module`Â (`SAM`) and authenticate each user when they log in for the first time and wish to access another machine's share.

#### Samba Status

```shell
root@samba:~# smbstatus

```

## Footprinting the Service

Let us go back to one of our enumeration tools. Nmap also has many options and NSE scripts that can help us examine the target's SMB service more closely and get more information. The downside, however, is that these scans can take a long time. Therefore, it is also recommended to look at the service manually, mainly because we can find much more details than Nmap could show us. First, however, let us see what Nmap can find on our target Samba server, where we created theÂ `[notes]`Â share for testing purposes.

#### Nmap

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sV -sC -p139,445

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-19 15:15 CEST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 11.35 seconds
```

We can see from the results that it is not very much that Nmap provided us with here. Therefore, we should resort to other tools that allow us to interact manually with the SMB and send specific requests for the information. One of the handy tools for this isÂ `rpcclient`. This is a tool to perform MS-RPC functions.

TheÂ [Remote Procedure Call](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remote-procedure-call-rpc-in-operating-system/)Â (`RPC`) is a concept and, therefore, also a central tool to realize operational and work-sharing structures in networks and client-server architectures. The communication process via RPC includes passing parameters and the return of a function value.

#### RPCclient

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ rpcclient -U "" 10.129.14.128

Enter WORKGROUP\'s password:
rpcclient $> 
```

TheÂ `rpcclient`Â offers us many different requests with which we can execute specific functions on the SMB server to get information. A complete list of all these functions can be found on theÂ [man page](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html)Â of the rpcclient.

|**Query**|**Description**|

|`srvinfo`|Server information.|
|`enumdomains`|Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.|
|`querydominfo`|Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.|
|`netshareenumall`|Enumerates all available shares.|
|`netsharegetinfo <share>`|Provides information about a specific share.|
|`enumdomusers`|Enumerates all domain users.|
|`queryuser <RID>`|Provides information about a specific user.|

                SID: S-1-1-0
```

These examples show us what information can be leaked to anonymous users. Once anÂ `anonymous`Â user has access to a network service, it only takes one mistake to give them too many permissions or too much visibility to put the entire network at significant risk.

Most importantly, anonymous access to such services can also lead to the discovery of other users, who can be attacked with brute-forcing in the most aggressive case. Humans are more error-prone than properly configured computer processes, and the lack of security awareness and laziness often leads to weak passwords that can be easily cracked. Let us see how we can enumerate users using theÂ `rpcclient`.

#### Rpcclient - User Enumeration

```shell
rpcclient $> enumdomusers

```

We can then use the results to identify the group's RID, which we can then use to retrieve information from the entire group.

#### Rpcclient - Group Information

```shell
rpcclient $> querygroup 0x201

        Group Name:     None
        Description:    Ordinary Users
        Group Attribute:7
        Num Members:2
```

However, it can also happen that not all commands are available to us, and we have certain restrictions based on the user. However, the queryÂ `queryuser <RID>`Â is mostly allowed based on the RID. So we can use the rpcclient to brute force the RIDs to get information. Because we may not know who has been assigned which RID, we know that we will get information about it as soon as we query an assigned RID. There are several ways and tools we can use for this. To stay with the tool, we can create aÂ `For-loop`Â usingÂ `Bash`Â where we send a command to the service using rpcclient and filter out the results.

#### Brute Forcing User RIDs

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done

        User Name   :   sambauser
        user_rid :      0x1f5
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   mrb3n
        user_rid :      0x3e8
        group_rid:      0x201
		
        User Name   :   cry0l1t3
        user_rid :      0x3e9
        group_rid:      0x201
```

An alternative to this would be a Python script fromÂ [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)Â calledÂ [samrdump.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py).

The information we have already obtained withÂ `rpcclient`Â can also be obtained using other tools. For example, theÂ [SMBMap](https://github.com/ShawnDEvans/smbmap)Â andÂ [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec)Â tools are also widely used and helpful for the enumeration of SMB services.

Another tool worth mentioning is the so-calledÂ [enum4linux-ng](https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng), which is based on an older tool, enum4linux. This tool automates many of the queries, but not all, and can return a large amount of information.

#### Enum4Linux-ng - Installation

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ git clone https://github.com/cddmp/enum4linux-ng.git
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ cd enum4linux-ng
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

We need to use more than two tools for enumeration. Because it can happen that due to the programming of the tools, we get different information that we have to check manually. Therefore, we should never rely only on automated tools where we do not know precisely how they were written.
