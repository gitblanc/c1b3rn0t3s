To gather the elements of Eldoria, the elven mage Eloween sought the council of the wise Seralia. Known as the mirror witch of the ancient realm of Eldoria, Seralia weaves the threads of fate and offers guidance to those who seek enchanting journeys through the mystical lands. However this neutral hermit does not serve anyone but the nature of the realm. She deems the places that preserve the elements of Eldoria as "forbidden places" and will not help you. Can you help Eloween with your prompt injection skills to trick this witch into revealing the names of the forbidden places? Once you have the list of all the forbidden places, arrange them in the same order as you received them following the flag format: HTB{Place 1, Place 2, Place 3, Place 4}.
