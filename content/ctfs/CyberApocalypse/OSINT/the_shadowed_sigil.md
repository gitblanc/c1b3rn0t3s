In the central chamber of Eldoria's Arcane Archives, Nyla studies a glowing sigil captured by the royal wardens. The ethereal marking—"139.5.177.205"—pulsates with malicious energy, having appeared in multiple magical breaches across the realm. Her fingers trace the sigil's unique pattern as her network of crystals begins to search through records of known dark covens and their magical signatures. The runes along her sleeves flash with recognition as connections form between seemingly unrelated incidents. Each magical attack bears the same underlying pattern, the same arcane origin. Her enchanted sight follows the magical threads backward through time and space until the name of a notorious cabal of shadow mages materializes in glowing script. Another dangerous secret revealed by Eldoria's master information seeker, who knows that even the most elusive malefactors leave traces of their magic for those skilled enough to recognize their unique signature.
