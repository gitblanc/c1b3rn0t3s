The Royal Archives of Eldoria have recovered a mysterious documentâ€”an old resume once belonging to Lord Malakar before his fall from grace. At first glance, it appears to be an ordinary record of his achievements as a noble knight, but hidden within the text are secrets that reveal his descent into darkness.

We get an `email.eml`:

There is an `index.php`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250322130153.png)

I'll capture the request. At the end of the response there is a script that is trying to access something:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250322131213.png)

I'll try to access the resource `http://storage.microsoftcloudservices.com:40599/3fe1690d955e8fd2a0b282501570e1f4/`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250322131308.png)

Then If I go to `http://storage.microsoftcloudservices.com:40599/3fe1690d955e8fd2a0b282501570e1f4/configs/client.py`:

![](Pasted%20image%2020250322131450.png)

Then If we decode it from base64:
